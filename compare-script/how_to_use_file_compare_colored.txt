XML Visual String Comparison Tool
=================================

This script provides a visual, colored diff of text changes between two XML files,
highlighting exactly which characters were added, removed, or changed.

DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY, use standart version instead

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries only (difflib for text comparison)
- Terminal/console that supports ANSI color codes

Usage:
1. Run in command line:
   python compare_same_xml_files_colored.py path/to/first.xml path/to/second.xml

   for example:
   python compare_same_xml_files_colored.py path/to/old_0001.xml  path/to/new_0001.xml

Features:
- Side-by-side visual comparison of text changes
- Color-coded output:
  * Red: Removed characters
  * Green: Added characters
  * Yellow: ID headers
- Shows character-level differences within strings
- Best for identifying small changes in long strings
- Compact output focusing only on changed strings

Output:
- Colorful display of differences for each changed ID
- Character-level highlighting within changed text
- Total count of changed strings

Example:
python compare_same_xml_files_colored.py old.xml new.xml

Output example:
============================================================
Visual Comparison: old.xml vs new.xml

Notes:
- Requires terminal that supports ANSI colors (most modern terminals do)
- Best viewed in terminals with dark backgrounds
- For long strings, shows inline diff rather than side-by-side
- Colors help quickly spot additions (green) and deletions (red)
- Use for detailed review of specific changes
