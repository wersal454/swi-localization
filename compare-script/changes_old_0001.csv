Manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards, this quad-barreled turbolaser was specifically engineered to counter the increasing threat of Rebel starfighter attacks on Imperial capital ships.\n\nBy sacrificing per-shot damage for enhanced targeting systems and a higher rate of fire, the PD Quad provides effective coverage against fast-moving targets that would otherwise evade heavier turbolaser batteries. Its reduced power requirements also allow for installation on vessels where power distribution is a concern.\n\nCommonly found on the Executor Super Star Destroyer and other Imperial vessels, the PD Quad has proven itself an essential component of layered defensive systems."

510130,New, "The Sith Empire's history is long, bloody, and often forgotten.\nOriginating on the world of Korriban, the Sith were a red-skinned species of humanoids capable of using the dark side of the Force. For thousands of years the Sith existed in isolation, their society shaped by strict hierarchies, constant internal strife, and a cultural devotion to strength and power. This period would come to a close, however, upon the arrival of Dark Jedi exiled from the Old Republic. These Dark Jedi embedded themselves in the culture and bloodline of the Sith, eventually taking the Sith name as the foundation of their ideology and the Sith empire as the base of their rising power. Under their influence, the Sith Empire, known often as the Sith Order, began a cycle of expansion into the galaxy, war against the Jedi and Republic, defeat, and rebirth.\n\nTheir overzealous ambitions would prove to be their downfall, and the end of the New Sith Wars led to Darth Bane instituting the Rule of Two, forcing the Sith into secrecy for almost a thousand years until Darths Sidious, Maul, and Tyrannus revealed themselves to the galaxy at the end of the Galactic Republic.\n\nYet the Sith Empire did not cease to exist with the eradication of its leadership. With the Dark Lords gone, control fell instead to cult fanatics and devoted adherents who claimed stewardship of Sith tradition. These groups withdrew the remnants of the Empire into hiding. Cut off from the wider galaxy by forgotten and forbidden hyperlanes, the Empire was left undisturbed. With no outside powers able to reach them and no Sith hierarchy remaining to seize control, the cult leadership rebuilt the Empire according to its own rigid beliefs.\n\nIn this isolation the cult restored the Empire`s fleets, expanded its hidden holdings, and enforced Sith doctrine through strict internal hierarchy. Over the course of centuries, this period of uncontested regrowth transformed the surviving Empire into a disciplined and insular power, shaped not by Sith Lords but by the fanaticism of the cult that endured in their place."

Located at the beginning of the Rimma Trade Route, it is a prosperous trade and manufacturing world, but was still considered as backwards as an Outer Rim planet: Beyond the relative safety of the spaceports, Abregado-rae is a wilderness. Discovered ten millennia before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Abregado was not colonised for thousands of years more. During the Jedi Civil War, it joined Darth Revan's Sith Empire, and during the Clone Wars Abregado remained part of the Republic."
900102,New, "Abregado-rae is a planet located in the Abregado system of the Core Worlds region, positioned at the beginning of the Rimma Trade Route hyperlane. Despite its location in the Core, Abregado-rae has long been considered a backwater world, with a reputation more befitting an Outer Rim planet than one of the galaxy's central systems.\n\nThe planet's surface features varied terrain including vast plains, mountain ranges, and scattered urban centers. However, beyond the relative safety of its spaceports, Abregado-rae remains largely wild and undeveloped, with dangerous wilderness areas dominating much of the landscape.\n\nAbregado-rae was discovered approximately ten thousand years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, during the early expansion era of the Galactic Republic. Despite this early discovery, the planet remained uncolonized for thousands of years afterward, with settlers showing little interest in its remote location and challenging environment.\n\nEventually, the Gado ethnic group established settlements on Abregado-rae, giving the planet its name. These hardy colonists built their communities despite the planet's isolation and the dangers posed by its wilderness regions. Over time, Abregado-rae developed a modest economy based on trade and light manufacturing, though it never achieved the prosperity or prominence of other Core Worlds.\n\nThe planet's position at the start of the Rimma Trade Route gave it some strategic importance as a waypoint for vessels traveling between the Core and the Outer Rim. However, this advantage was offset by the planet's reputation for lawlessness and danger outside its urban centers.\n\nDuring the Jedi Civil War, approximately 3,959 years before the rise of the Empire, Abregado-rae fell under the control of Darth Revan's Sith Empire. The planet remained in Sith hands until Revan's defeat and the restoration of Republic authority.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Abregado-rae remained loyal to the Galactic Republic. The planet's strategic position along the Rimma Trade Route made it valuable for Republic military logistics, serving as a waypoint for supply convoys moving through the Core.\n\nEarly in the Clone Wars, the Malevolence, a massive Separatist warship equipped with ion cannons capable of disabling entire fleets, attacked Republic forces near Abregado-rae. The ship destroyed a Republic medical convoy in the Abregado system, with few survivors. Jedi Master Plo Koon and several clone troopers were rescued from the wreckage by Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano before the Malevolence could finish them off.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Abregado-rae came under Imperial control. The Empire maintained a presence on the planet to monitor trade along the Rimma Trade Route and maintain order, though the garrison remained relatively modest given the planet's backwater status.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Abregado-rae remained under Imperial control for most of the conflict. However, the planet's reputation for lawlessness and its position along a major trade route made it a location of interest for both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Smugglers and independent traders frequently used Abregado-rae as a waypoint, taking advantage of the planet's loosely enforced regulations.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Abregado-rae's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of strategic positions along the Rimma Trade Route."

Originally colonized by Alderaanian colonists who were drawn to the planet's natural beauty rather than its resource potential, Adarlon developed a culture that emphasized art, entertainment, and leisure over industrial development.\n\nThe planet's surface features varied terrain including mountains, forests, and coastlines, with settlements concentrated in areas of exceptional natural beauty. Unlike most frontier worlds, Adarlon's economy evolved around tourism and the entertainment industry rather than mining or manufacturing. The capital city became a center for holodrama production, music, and various forms of artistic expression.\n\nAdarlon's unique cultural focus attracted artists, performers, and tourists from across the galaxy, establishing it as one of the premier entertainment destinations in the Outer Rim. The planet's theaters, concert halls, and holodrama studios rivaled those of more established worlds in the Core.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Adarlon maintained a degree of neutrality, though its cultural ties to Alderaan meant many citizens sympathized with the Republic cause. The planet avoided major battles, though its entertainment industry was affected by the galactic conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the destruction of Alderaan, Adarlon experienced a cultural crisis. Many citizens mourned the loss of their ancestral homeworld, and the planet became a gathering place for Alderaanian refugees and survivors. Despite this tragedy, the entertainment industry continued, though Imperial censorship and oversight brought new restrictions.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Adarlon remained under Imperial control, though many in the entertainment community secretly sympathized with the Rebel Alliance. Some artists and performers used their work to subtly criticize the Empire, while others provided covert support to the Rebellion.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Adarlon's remote location in the Outer Rim meant that no government made early claims on the system."

Following the collapse of that civilization, the planet remained independent for millennia, maintaining only sporadic contact with the Galactic Republic.\n\nApproximately 3,600 years before the rise of the Empire, during the aftermath of the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire, Agamar finally joined the Republic. The planet maintained its membership for thousands of years, though its remote location meant Republic influence remained limited.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Agamar remained loyal to the Republic, though its isolation spared it from major battles. The planet continued its traditional agricultural economy throughout the conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Agamar came under Imperial control. The Empire established a garrison on the planet to maintain order and collect taxes, though full control was never achieved. The planet's rural population and scattered settlements made comprehensive Imperial oversight difficult.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, resistance to Imperial rule strengthened over time. Many Agamarians secretly sympathized with the Rebel Alliance, providing covert support despite the risks. The planet's agricultural products continued to be exported throughout the Outer Rim, though tensions between the local population and Imperial authorities remained high.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Agamar's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for influence in the Outer Rim territories."

The planet's surface is almost entirely covered by endless seas, with only scattered rocky islands breaking through the waves. These islands feature steep cliffs, ancient stone structures, and lush vegetation thriving in the temperate maritime climate.\n\nAhch-To holds immense significance as the legendary birthplace of the Jedi Order. Thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the first Jedi Temple was established on one of Ahch-To's islands. This sacred site became the foundation of the Jedi Order, serving as the initial gathering place for Force-sensitives seeking to understand the mysteries of the Force.\n\nThe planet's isolation made it ideal for contemplation and study. The Prime Jedi, the first member of the Order, meditated on Ahch-To and established the philosophical foundations that would guide the Jedi for millennia. The temple contained the original Jedi texts, ancient documents recording the earliest teachings, philosophies, and discoveries about the Force.\n\nThese sacred texts included writings on Force philosophy, meditation techniques, and fundamental light side principles. They were inscribed on stone, metal, and specially treated materials designed to withstand time, representing the accumulated wisdom of the earliest Force users.\n\nAs the Jedi Order grew and expanded, Ahch-To's importance diminished. The Order established new temples on more accessible worlds, and the remote planet gradually faded from memory. The hyperspace routes to Ahch-To were lost, and its location became shrouded in mystery.\n\nBy the Old Republic era, Ahch-To existed primarily in ancient Jedi lore. Most Jedi knew of it only through stories, tales of the Order's mythical birthplace in the Unknown Regions. Its exact location became one of the Jedi's greatest mysteries.\n\nAhch-To is home to several native species. Porgs, small avian creatures, nest among the cliffs. Thala-sirens, large aquatic mammals, inhabit the surrounding seas. The Caretakers, amphibious beings, maintain the ancient Jedi structures, preserving them even after the Order forgot the planet's location.\n\nThe climate features frequent storms, strong winds, and rough seas. The constant ocean presence influences all life, from hardy vegetation to species adapted to marine and terrestrial environments.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars and the Empire's rise, Ahch-To remained isolated from galactic events. The ancient temple continued to stand, weathered but preserved by its remote location and the Caretakers' maintenance.\n\nFollowing Order 66 and the Jedi Order's fall, Ahch-To's significance grew. With Jedi temples destroyed or desecrated by the Empire, Ahch-To remained as one of few intact repositories of ancient Jedi knowledge. However, its location remained unknown to both surviving Jedi and the Empire.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Ahch-To continued its isolated existence, unknown to the wider galaxy. The ancient temple and sacred texts remained hidden, waiting to be rediscovered by those who might one day restore the Jedi Order."

The abundant rainfall and fertile soil support a rich ecosystem, though no sapient species are native to the moon.\n\nDue to its remote location far from major hyperspace routes, Ajan Kloss attracted little attention from galactic governments or explorers. The moon's isolation and lack of strategic resources meant it remained pristine and untouched by industrial development.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Ajan Kloss was occasionally noted on star charts as a potential waypoint for explorers venturing into the Unknown Regions, though few vessels made the journey to its location. The moon's dense jungles and lack of civilization made it an unappealing destination for colonization efforts.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars and the subsequent rise of the Galactic Empire, Ajan Kloss remained undisturbed. Its distance from the conflicts that engulfed the galaxy allowed the moon to maintain its pristine natural state.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Ajan Kloss continued its existence in obscurity, unknown to both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. The moon's thick canopy and remote location made it an ideal hiding place, though no faction utilized it during this period.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and throughout the early years of the New Republic, Ajan Kloss remained an unremarkable jungle moon on the fringes of explored space, its potential as a base or refuge yet to be discovered."

Known for its natural beauty, peaceful philosophy, and cultural achievements, Alderaan was a center of learning and diplomacy throughout galactic history.\n\nThe planet featured diverse terrain including mountains, plains, oceans, and forests, with cities built to harmonize with the environment. The University of Alderaan was among the galaxy's most prestigious institutions, while Alderaanian artists and philosophers contributed immeasurably to galactic culture.\n\nAlderaan maintained its commitment to peace throughout its history, refusing to keep a standing military beyond a ceremonial guard. During the Clone Wars, Viceroy Bail Organa led the planet in supporting the Republic while providing humanitarian aid across the galaxy. As Chancellor Palpatine accumulated power, Organa grew increasingly concerned about democratic erosion, working with Senators Padmé Amidala and Mon Mothma to oppose the growing authoritarianism.\n\nAfter Order 66 and the Empire's rise, Bail Organa publicly accepted Imperial rule to protect his people while secretly founding the Alliance to Restore the Republic. He adopted Padmé's daughter Leia, raising her as Princess of Alderaan. The planet became the Rebellion's secret headquarters, with Organa using Alderaan's wealth and diplomatic connections to fund and organize resistance.\n\nPrincess Leia joined her father's cause, serving as both Imperial Senator and key Rebel leader. However, Imperial authorities grew suspicious of Alderaan's role in supporting the Rebellion.\n\nIn 0 BBY, after capturing Princess Leia with the stolen Death Star plans, Grand Moff Tarkin brought the battle station to Alderaan. To force Leia to reveal the Rebel base location, he threatened to destroy her homeworld. Despite Leia providing false information, Tarkin ordered Alderaan destroyed anyway ""to demonstrate the power of this station.""\n\nThe Death Star's superlaser fired, completely destroying Alderaan and killing all two billion inhabitants instantly. The planet shattered into asteroids, erasing thousands of years of culture and civilization in moments. The massive loss of life created a disturbance in the Force felt across the galaxy.\n\nRather than intimidating the galaxy into submission, Alderaan's destruction galvanized support for the Rebellion. ""Remember Alderaan"" became a rallying cry, strengthening resistance against Imperial tyranny. Shortly after, the Rebel Alliance destroyed the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin.\n\nThe asteroid field known as 'the Graveyard' became a memorial to the destroyed world. Only a few hundred thousand Alderaanians who were off-planet survived, scattered as refugees throughout the galaxy. These survivors worked to preserve their culture and ensure their homeworld's legacy endured.\n\nPrincess Leia, devastated but defiant, continued leading the Rebellion with renewed determination. After Endor, she helped establish the New Republic, working to build the democratic institutions Alderaan had championed. Though Alderaan was gone, its ideals of compassion, justice, and commitment to peace continued inspiring the galaxy, serving as both a reminder of Imperial cruelty and a symbol of resistance against tyranny."

The system lies along the Lorell Route hyperlane, connecting it to the neighboring Lorell and Sennex systems.\n\nThe Hapes Cluster, including the Andalia system, remained isolated from the greater galaxy for thousands of years, protected by the dangerous Transitory Mists that surround the cluster. This isolation allowed the Hapan culture to develop independently under matriarchal rule.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, the Andalia system was part of the territory controlled by the Lorell Raiders, pirates who preyed upon passing ships until they were defeated by the Jedi. Following their defeat, the surviving pirates and their captured mates formed the basis of Hapan society, establishing the matriarchal traditions that would define the Hapes Consortium.\n\nThroughout the millennia that followed, Andalia remained under the control of the Queen Mother and the Hapan Royal Court. The system maintained the isolationist policies that characterized the Hapes Consortium, with limited contact with the outside galaxy.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars and throughout the Galactic Civil War, the Hapes Consortium maintained its traditional neutrality, and Andalia remained isolated from the conflict that engulfed much of the galaxy.

900802,New, "Annaj is a remote, fog-shrouded planet located in the Outer Rim Territories. A world perpetually covered in thick mists and atmospheric haze, Annaj's surface features varied terrain including forests, plains, and scattered settlements adapted to the planet's limited visibility conditions.\n\nDiscovered approximately three hundred years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Annaj's strategic position made it valuable as a waypoint for vessels traveling into isolated sectors. Despite its remote location, the planet developed a modest population based on serving traders and explorers venturing into the deep Outer Rim and Wild Space.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Annaj maintained a quiet existence as a frontier world. The planet joined the Galactic Republic but remained largely peripheral to Core Worlds politics and conflicts. Throughout the Clone Wars, Annaj's isolation spared it from direct involvement in the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Annaj's fate changed dramatically when Imperial strategists recognized its potential value. The planet's remote location and natural concealment provided by perpetual fog made it attractive for covert military operations.\n\nDuring construction of the second Death Star above Endor, Annaj's importance increased significantly. The Empire designated the planet as a major staging area for the Imperial Navy, coordinating supply shipments and troop movements to the Endor system. The fog-covered world proved ideal for concealing the massive military buildup, with Star Destroyers and supply vessels using Annaj as a mustering point before proceeding to Endor.\n\nImperial forces constructed expanded military facilities on Annaj's surface and in orbit, transforming the quiet frontier world into a bustling military hub. The local population found themselves under increased Imperial oversight as garrison troops and naval personnel flooded the planet. The Empire maintained strict security protocols, restricting civilian traffic and monitoring communications to prevent information leaks to the Rebel Alliance.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Endor and the destruction of the second Death Star, Annaj again played a crucial role. As news of the Emperor's death reached Imperial forces, many commanders ordered vessels to fall back to pre-designated rally points. Annaj, having served as a staging area during construction, was one such location.\n\nImperial forces retreated to Annaj in significant numbers, with Star Destroyers gathering at the fog-shrouded world while commanders assessed the situation. The planet became a temporary refuge for Imperial personnel evacuating from Endor and nearby sectors where Rebel forces advanced.\n\nThe concentration of Imperial assets made Annaj strategically significant immediately after Endor, though the Empire's fractured command structure meant little coordination among forces that had retreated there. Some commanders sought to regroup and continue fighting, while others questioned whether the Empire could survive.\n\nAs months passed and the full extent of the Empire's defeat became clear, Imperial forces at Annaj began to disperse. Some vessels departed to join Imperial warlords and remnant factions, while others were recalled to defend Core territories. The planet's brief moment as a major Imperial stronghold faded as the Empire's authority fragmented.\n\nAfter formation of the New Republic, Annaj's status became uncertain as various factions competed for control of strategic Outer Rim positions."

900902,New, "Anoat is a heavily polluted industrial world located in the Anoat system of the Greater Javin region in the Outer Rim Territories. Positioned strategically between the Hoth and Bespin systems along the Ison Corridor, Anoat has long served as a waypoint for travelers navigating this remote sector of space.\n\nThe planet's surface is dominated by sprawling industrial complexes, factories, and mining operations that have transformed much of the landscape into a haze-covered wasteland. Centuries of unchecked industrialization have resulted in severe atmospheric pollution, with toxic smog blanketing many urban areas. Despite these harsh conditions, Anoat maintains a substantial population of workers, traders, and various species drawn by employment opportunities in its factories and shipyards.\n\nAnoat's economy revolves primarily around heavy manufacturing and resource processing. The planet's industrial infrastructure produces everything from starship components to mining equipment, with goods exported throughout the Greater Javin region and beyond. However, the environmental cost of this industrial prowess has been severe, with large sections of the planet rendered nearly uninhabitable by pollution and industrial waste.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Anoat was discovered by early explorers charting the Ison Corridor. The planet's mineral wealth and strategic location made it an attractive target for colonization, and within a few centuries, it had developed into a significant industrial center. However, the lack of environmental regulations during this period of rapid growth set the stage for the ecological degradation that would define the planet's future.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Anoat remained officially neutral, though its industrial output made it valuable to both the Republic and the Separatists. The planet's factories continued operation throughout the conflict, selling to whoever could pay, which earned Anoat a reputation for pragmatism over ideology.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Anoat fell under Imperial control. The Empire pressed the planet's industrial capacity into service, establishing garrison forces and administrative oversight to ensure continued production of military equipment. Imperial occupation brought increased regulation but also increased quotas, further straining the planet's already stressed environment and workforce.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Anoat remained under firm Imperial control due to its strategic position near both Hoth and Bespin. Following the Battle of Hoth, when the Rebel Alliance evacuated their base on that frozen world, many fleeing Rebel ships passed through or near the Anoat system.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, the Imperial forces in the Greater Javin region, including Anoat, established what became known as the Iron Blockade. This military cordon sealed off the entire sector from the rest of the galaxy, with Imperial authorities refusing to acknowledge reports of the Emperor's demise. The blockade lasted for several months, during which time the sector remained isolated, with residents unaware of the dramatic changes occurring in the broader galaxy.\n\nEventually, the Iron Blockade collapsed as Imperial authority fragmented, and news of the Empire's defeat finally reached Anoat. The planet subsequently came under the influence of various factions competing for control in the post-Imperial era, including the New Republic, Imperial remnants, and criminal organizations seeking to exploit the power vacuum."

The planet's surface is dominated by vast prairies known as the Unity of Community, where enormous herds of native herbivores roam freely across the endless plains.\n\nThe planet is home to two sentient species: the Ansionians, a humanoid race who live primarily in cities, and the Alwari, nomadic tribes who inhabit the prairies and maintain a traditional lifestyle centered around herding and tribal customs. The Alwari are divided into numerous clans, each with their own territories and traditions, and they have historically maintained an uneasy relationship with the city-dwelling Ansionians.\n\nAnsion's importance to the Galactic Republic extended beyond its own borders due to a complex web of treaties and alliances with neighboring systems. The planet served as a linchpin in a network of agreements that bound together numerous Mid Rim worlds. Should Ansion secede from the Republic, these treaty obligations would potentially trigger a cascade of secessions throughout the region.\n\nDuring the final years of the Galactic Republic, tensions between the Ansionians and the Alwari threatened the planet's stability. The Separatist movement, recognizing Ansion's strategic importance, sought to exploit these tensions to encourage the planet to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n\nIn the months before the Clone Wars, the Jedi Council dispatched a team of Jedi, including Luminara Unduli and her Padawan Barriss Offee, along with Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker, to mediate the disputes between the Ansionians and the Alwari. The mission proved successful, with the Jedi helping to broker a peace agreement that satisfied both groups and kept Ansion loyal to the Republic.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Ansion remained under Republic control, though its strategic position made it a target of interest for both sides of the conflict. The planet's vast grasslands and relatively sparse urban development meant that much of the world remained largely unaffected by the wider galactic war.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Ansion came under Imperial authority. The Empire maintained a presence on the planet to ensure compliance with Imperial law, though the traditional way of life of the Alwari tribes continued much as it had for generations. The grasslands of Ansion remained largely unchanged, with the great herds continuing their ancient migrations across the plains.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Ansion's strategic location along the Namadii Corridor meant it remained under Imperial control for most of the conflict. However, the planet's complex treaty network, which had once bound it so closely to the Republic, had largely dissolved under Imperial rule, diminishing its former strategic importance.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Ansion sits precariously on the border on the border of the remnants of the Empire. Many hope that the restoration of democracy will bring renewed prosperity to the planet and its people."

Arkanis developed into a moderately populated world with several major cities and spaceports that served as waypoints for travelers along the Triellus Trade Route.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Arkanis served as the throneworld of the Arkanis Regency, a powerful government that controlled much of the surrounding sector. The ancient Empress Teeda ruled from Arkanis, establishing traditions and governmental structures that influenced the region for millennia to come.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Arkanis joined the Galactic Republic and became an important administrative center for the Outer Rim. The planet maintained steady economic growth through trade and served as a regional military staging point during various conflicts throughout the millennia.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Arkanis remained loyal to the Republic, serving as a logistics hub for Republic forces operating in the Outer Rim. The planet's strategic position along the Triellus Trade Route made it valuable for military operations in the surrounding sectors.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Arkanis took on even greater importance. The Empire recognized the planet's strategic value and established it as a major military center. The Imperial Academy on Arkanis became one of the most prestigious military training facilities in the Outer Rim, producing officers for both the Imperial Army and Navy.\n\nThe Arkanis Academy developed a reputation for excellence, with its graduates serving throughout the Imperial military. The facility emphasized discipline, tactical training, and loyalty to the Empire, producing some of the Imperial military's most capable officers.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Arkanis remained firmly under Imperial control. The planet's military installations and strategic location made it a priority for Imperial defense. The Empire maintained a strong garrison on Arkanis throughout the conflict, using it as a staging point for operations against Rebel forces in the Outer Rim.\n\nThe planet's industrial infrastructure supported the Imperial war effort, producing military equipment and supplies. Arkanis's shipyards, while smaller than those of major industrial worlds, contributed vessels and components to the Imperial Navy.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the fragmentation of Imperial authority, Arkanis found itself under Commerce Guild control as various warlords and Imperial remnant factions competed for dominance in the Outer Rim.

901202,New, "Ast Kikorie is a terrestrial planet located in the Moddell sector of the Outer Rim Territories, positioned in grid square H-16 of the Standard Galactic Grid. The planet is locally known by the colloquial name ""Down Below,"" a reference that reflects its position relative to the orbital infrastructure that has defined the system throughout its recorded history.\n\nThe planet's surface features varied terrain suitable for habitation, though it never developed into a major population center. During the Old Republic era, Ast Kikorie was selected by the Galactic Republic as the site for an astrocartographic research outpost, recognizing the system's strategic value for mapping and studying the Outer Rim Territories and the regions beyond.\n\nThe Republic established an extensive orbital telescope array around Ast Kikorie, creating a sophisticated astronomical observation network. Multiple space telescopes were positioned in strategic orbits, their advanced sensor arrays designed to peer deep into unexplored regions of space. These telescopes worked in coordination, providing Republic astronomers and cartographers with unprecedented data about distant star systems, potential hyperspace routes, and stellar phenomena.\n\nKikorie City, the primary settlement on Ast Kikorie's surface, served as the administrative and operational center for the research facility. The city was connected to the orbital telescope ring by an impressive skyhook - a massive space elevator that allowed personnel, equipment, and data to move efficiently between the surface and the orbiting research stations. This engineering marvel became one of the defining features of the Ast Kikorie system, visible from great distances as vessels approached the planet.\n\nThe astrocartographic research conducted at Ast Kikorie proved valuable to the Republic's understanding of the Outer Rim and the Unknown Regions beyond. Data collected by the orbital telescopes helped refine navigational charts, identify potentially habitable worlds for future colonization, and monitor stellar activity that might affect hyperspace routes. Republic scientists and researchers stationed at Kikorie City analyzed this constant stream of information, contributing to the Republic's growing knowledge of the galaxy.\n\nHowever, the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY dramatically altered Ast Kikorie's status. As the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems engulfed much of the galaxy, the Republic was forced to reassess its priorities and redeploy resources to support the war effort. Remote research facilities like Ast Kikorie, while scientifically valuable, were deemed non-essential compared to the immediate needs of the Grand Army of the Republic.\n\nFaced with the necessity of concentrating forces and resources in strategically vital systems, the Republic made the difficult decision to abandon Ast Kikorie at the onset of the Clone Wars. Research personnel were evacuated from both Kikorie City and the orbital stations, taking with them whatever equipment and data could be transported. The orbital telescope array and the skyhook were left behind, too massive and complex to dismantle and relocate on short notice.\n\nThe abandonment of Ast Kikorie represented a significant loss to Republic scientific endeavors, as the sophisticated observation network had been operational for generations and had accumulated vast archives of astronomical data. However, the exigencies of war left Republic leadership with little choice but to prioritize military necessities over scientific research.\n\nFollowing the Republic's withdrawal, Ast Kikorie became a ghost world. Kikorie City stood empty, its buildings and facilities gradually succumbing to neglect and the elements. The orbital telescope array continued to orbit the planet, though without maintenance or supervision, many of the instruments began to fail or drift out of alignment. The skyhook, once a marvel of engineering, remained suspended between surface and orbit, a silent monument to the Republic's abandoned ambitions in the Outer Rim.\n\nThe Clone Wars raged across the galaxy while Ast Kikorie remained isolated and forgotten. Neither the Republic nor the Confederacy showed interest in reoccupying the system, as its scientific infrastructure held little military value and its remote location made it strategically insignificant to the larger conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the end of the Clone Wars, Ast Kikorie remained abandoned. The Empire showed no interest in resuming the Republic's astrocartographic research at the facility, focusing its astronomical efforts elsewhere. The once-proud research outpost continued to deteriorate, with Kikorie City slowly being reclaimed by nature and the orbital infrastructure degrading without maintenance.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Ast Kikorie's abandoned status persisted. The planet's remote location and lack of resources meant neither the Empire nor the Rebel Alliance devoted attention to the forgotten world. Occasional scavengers and salvagers might have visited the system seeking to strip valuable components from the orbital telescopes or the skyhook, though the difficulty of such operations and the remote location limited such activity.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Ast Kikorie remained an abandoned outpost, a reminder of the Republic's peaceful scientific endeavors that had been sacrificed to the necessities of war. The orbital telescope array, or what remained of it, continued to circle the planet, a derelict monument to astronomical research and the cost of galactic conflict."

The native human population, known as Atrisians, are renowned throughout the galaxy for their distinctive cultural traditions, including elaborate tea ceremonies, calligraphy, and martial arts.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Atrisia was discovered by early Republic explorers and became one of the first Core Worlds to join the Galactic Republic. Despite its membership in the Republic, Atrisia maintained considerable autonomy and preserved its unique cultural identity throughout the millennia. The planet developed into a regional power within the Core, with the Atrisian Commonwealth extending influence over several neighboring systems.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Atrisia was known for producing skilled warriors, diplomats, and artists. The planet's military tradition emphasized discipline and strategic thinking, with Atrisian officers serving with distinction in Republic forces. However, Atrisia also maintained its own defense forces, reflecting the world's independent nature.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Atrisia remained loyal to the Republic, though the planet's leadership was cautious about becoming too deeply involved in the conflict. The Atrisian government provided support to the Republic war effort while focusing on maintaining stability within the Commonwealth.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Atrisia initially accepted Imperial rule, though many Atrisians were uncomfortable with the authoritarian nature of the new government. The Empire maintained a presence on the planet to ensure compliance, though Atrisia's strategic importance and economic value meant the Empire was cautious about interfering too heavily in local affairs.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Atrisia remained under Imperial control, serving as an important administrative and economic center in the Core Worlds. The planet's shipyards and manufacturing facilities contributed to the Imperial war effort, though many Atrisians privately sympathized with the Rebel Alliance.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Atrisia's leadership retained independance continuing to preserve Atrisian cultural traditions and autonomy."

Despite its isolation, Bakura maintained contact with the Republic through its single hyperspace route.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Bakura's distance from the main conflict zones meant it saw little direct involvement in the fighting. The planet remained nominally loyal to the Republic, though its isolation meant Republic authority was limited.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Bakura came under Imperial control. The Empire established a garrison on the planet and used it as a remote outpost for monitoring Wild Space. Imperial presence brought increased oversight and regulation to the traditionally independent Bakurans, causing growing resentment among the population.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Endor, the planet's strategic position as a gateway to Wild Space and unknown regions made it valuable despite its isolation. However, Bakura maintained a degree of autonomy, with the Bakuran Senate retaining significant control over local affairs."

901502,Old, "Balmorra is a factory world that is located within the Balmorra system, situated in a strategic position between the Colonies and the border of the Core Worlds. Due to its intense industrial manufacturing it is known as one of the most important foundry worlds in the Republic's space, where some of the most advanced weaponry and battle droids were constantly produced throughout most of the planet's history."
901502,New, "Balmorra is a heavily industrialized planet located in the Balmorra system of the Colonies region, positioned strategically between the Colonies and the Core Worlds along the Hydian Way hyperlane. One of the most important manufacturing worlds in the galaxy, Balmorra has been a major producer of weapons, droids, and military equipment for thousands of years.\n\nThe planet's surface is dominated by sprawling factories, weapons foundries, and industrial complexes that stretch across much of the landmass. Massive production facilities produce everything from blaster rifles to battle droids, with Balmorra's reputation for quality military hardware making it a prize sought by various galactic powers throughout history.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Balmorra was discovered and colonized, quickly developing into an industrial powerhouse. The planet joined the Galactic Republic and became one of its primary sources of military equipment. Balmorran Arms, one of the galaxy's premier weapons manufacturers, established its headquarters on the planet and became synonymous with reliable, effective weaponry.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Balmorra maintained steady growth as demand for its products increased. The planet's factories produced arms for Republic military forces and sold weapons to private buyers throughout known space. Balmorran society became heavily focused on industry and manufacturing, with most of the population employed in factories or related support industries.\n\nApproximately 3,600 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, during the Great Galactic War between the Galactic Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire, Balmorra became a major target. The Sith Empire recognized the planet's strategic value and launched an invasion to seize control of its weapons production. The Battle of Balmorra saw intense fighting as Republic forces attempted to defend the factories from Sith occupation.\n\nDespite determined resistance, the Sith Empire succeeded in conquering Balmorra, holding the planet for much of the subsequent Cold War period. The occupation proved costly for both sides, with Balmorran resistance fighters conducting guerrilla warfare against Imperial forces while the Sith worked to maintain production of weapons for their war machine. The planet changed hands several times over the following decades as the conflict between Republic and Empire continued.\n\nEventually, Balmorra was liberated and returned to Republic control, though the planet bore significant scars from years of warfare. The factories were rebuilt and modernized, and Balmorra resumed its role as a major weapons supplier to the Republic.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Balmorra remained loyal to the Galactic Republic, with its factories producing military equipment for the Grand Army of the Republic. The planet's droid foundries manufactured battle droids for Republic use, while its weapons facilities supplied blasters and other arms to clone troopers throughout the conflict. Balmorra's industrial capacity proved crucial to the Republic's war effort.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Balmorra came under Imperial control. The Empire immediately recognized the planet's value and established a strong military presence to ensure continued production. Imperial authorities nationalized much of Balmorra's industry, pressing the factories into service producing weapons and equipment exclusively for the Imperial military.\n\nThe transition to Imperial rule proved controversial among Balmorra's population. Many Balmorrans resented the Empire's heavy-handed control over their industries and the loss of independence that came with nationalization. However, the Empire's overwhelming military presence made open resistance difficult.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Balmorra remained under firm Imperial control due to its strategic importance. The Empire maintained a substantial garrison to protect the weapons factories and suppress any potential resistance. However, many Balmorrans secretly sympathized with the Rebel Alliance, and underground resistance movements operated covertly despite the risks.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Balmorra's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of the valuable industrial world. The planet's weapons production made it a crucial asset in the post-Imperial conflicts, with multiple factions recognizing that controlling Balmorra meant controlling a significant source of military hardware."

901602,Old, "Bandomeer is a planet in the Outer Rim Territories, on the Braxant Run. It is known for its high concentration of ionite, as well as the many predators lurking in its wildernesses. The planet's surface is roughly divided in half by a huge landmass and the Great Sea of Bandomeer."
901602,New, "Bandomeer is a planet located in the Outer Rim Territories along the Braxant Run hyperlane. A mineral-rich world known for its extensive ionite deposits, Bandomeer has long been exploited by mining corporations seeking to extract its valuable resources.\n\nThe planet's surface is roughly divided between a single large landmass and the Great Sea of Bandomeer. The terrain is characterized by rocky highlands, deep canyons, and scattered forests, with much of the landscape scarred by open-pit mining operations. Bandomeer's ecosystem includes various predatory species that lurk in the wilderness areas beyond the mining settlements.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Bandomeer was discovered and quickly became a target for mining interests. The planet's ionite deposits, used in various technological applications throughout the galaxy, made it economically valuable despite its remote location. However, the intensive mining operations came at a severe cost to both the environment and the native Meerian species.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Bandomeer fell under the control of various mining corporations, most notably Offworld Mining Corporation and its rival Arcona Mineral Harvest Corporation. These companies employed both free workers and slaves in brutal conditions, with little regard for safety or the wellbeing of their workforce. The planet developed a reputation as a harsh and dangerous place where fortunes could be made, but lives were cheap.\n\nThe Meerians, Bandomeer's native sentient species, suffered greatly under corporate exploitation. Many were displaced from their ancestral lands as mining operations expanded, while others were forced into indentured servitude working in the mines. The Meerians' traditional way of life, which had existed for millennia, was systematically destroyed by the relentless pursuit of profit.\n\nApproximately forty years before the rise of the Empire, the young Jedi Initiate Obi-Wan Kenobi was assigned to the Jedi Agricultural Corps and sent to Bandomeer, having not been chosen as a Padawan. During his journey, he encountered the legendary Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and became embroiled in a conflict between Offworld Mining Corporation and Arcona Mineral Harvest Corporation. Through these events, Kenobi demonstrated his capabilities and eventually became Qui-Gon's Padawan, beginning a partnership that would have profound implications for galactic history.\n\nThe conflict on Bandomeer exposed the corrupt practices of Offworld Mining Corporation, led by the ruthless Xanatos, a former Jedi who had turned to darkness. The corporation's defeat led to some reforms in mining operations on the planet, though exploitation continued under different management.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Bandomeer remained a relatively minor world, its remote location and focus on resource extraction keeping it largely isolated from the main theaters of conflict. The planet continued to supply ionite and other minerals to the Republic war effort, though under improved labor conditions compared to previous eras.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Bandomeer came under Imperial oversight. The Empire maintained interest in the planet's mineral wealth, using it to supply various Imperial projects. However, the Empire's own labor practices often proved as harsh as those of the old mining corporations, with political prisoners and other forced laborers sent to work in Bandomeer's mines.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Bandomeer remained under Imperial control, serving as a source of raw materials for the Imperial war machine. The planet's isolation and lack of strategic military importance meant it avoided major battles, though local resistance movements occasionally disrupted mining operations.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Bandomeer's status remained uncertain as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of resource-rich worlds in the Outer Rim. The planet's long history of exploitation and environmental degradation continued to impact its population and ecosystem, though there were hopes that new governance might bring reforms to the mining industry and improved conditions for workers and the native Meerians."

901702,Old, "Bastion is an industrialised planet located in the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy. Also part of the New Territories, it is connected via hyperspace route to Anthan Prime."
901702,New, "Bastion is a heavily industrialized planet located in the Braxant sector of the Outer Rim Territories, positioned along the Braxant Run hyperlane. A world of varied terrain including plains, forests, and mountain ranges, Bastion remained relatively obscure for much of galactic history until it became one of the most important worlds in the post-Imperial era.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Bastion was discovered and settled, though it never developed into a major population center. The planet maintained a modest economy based on light manufacturing and agriculture, with most inhabitants living quiet lives far from the political intrigues of the Core Worlds.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Bastion remained under Republic control, though its remote location spared it from major battles. The planet continued its traditional way of life despite the surrounding galactic conflicts.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Bastion fell under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the planet's potential for industrial development and began establishing manufacturing facilities and military installations. Imperial oversight brought increased regulation and development to what had been a relatively backwater world.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Bastion remained under Imperial control, serving as a minor industrial center and garrison world. The planet's location along the Braxant Run made it strategically useful for Imperial operations in the Outer Rim.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the fragmentation of Imperial authority, Bastion's importance increased dramatically. As the Empire collapsed and various warlords carved out their own territories, Bastion emerged as a rallying point for Imperial forces seeking to preserve what remained of the New Order.\n\nIn the years following the Emperor's death, Bastion became the de facto capital of the largest and most organized Imperial remnant. The planet's industrial infrastructure was rapidly expanded, with massive shipyards and military facilities constructed to support the remnant Empire's continued resistance against the New Republic. The world's strategic location and growing industrial capacity made it invaluable to Imperial forces attempting to hold the line against the advancing New Republic."

901802,Old, "Bellassa is an astronomical object located in the galaxy's Core Worlds. It is connected via the Hydian Way hyperspace route to Skako and Fedalle."
901802,New, "Bellassa is a terrestrial planet located in the Core Worlds region along the Hydian Way hyperlane. A world of varied terrain including mountains, forests, and urban centers, Bellassa developed into a significant industrial and commercial hub due to its strategic location on one of the galaxy's most important trade routes.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Bellassa became an important member world, known for its manufacturing capabilities and educated workforce. The planet's industrial capacity made it valuable to the Republic, with Bellassan products and technologies exported throughout the galaxy.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Bellassa remained loyal to the Galactic Republic, contributing significantly to the war effort through its factories and workforce.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Bellassa came under Imperial control. The transition proved traumatic as the Empire moved quickly to consolidate authority and suppress resistance. Imperial forces established a strong presence, recognizing both the planet's industrial importance and strategic position.\n\nThe Empire's occupation was characterized by increasing oppression and exploitation. Imperial authorities seized control of factories and resources, pressing them into service for the Imperial war machine. Many Bellassans opposed the authoritarian regime, and resistance cells formed almost immediately.\n\nApproximately nineteen years before the Battle of Yavin, former Jedi Padawan Ferus Olin lived on Bellassa under an assumed identity. When he was forced to rescue a captured former Jedi Master, his actions drew Imperial attention and inspired local resistance. Despite brutal Imperial repression including public executions and mass arrests, the Bellassan resistance continued to grow, attracting people from all walks of life.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Bellassa remained under firm Imperial control due to its strategic importance. The Empire maintained a strong garrison to protect vital factories and suppress resistance. However, the Bellassan resistance continued operating underground, conducting covert operations and providing intelligence to the Rebel Alliance.\n\nThe planet's position along the Hydian Way made it valuable for Imperial logistics, with supplies flowing through Bellassan spaceports. This also made it a target for Rebel intelligence operations seeking to disrupt Imperial supply lines.\n\nThe Empire's exploitation took a heavy toll on Bellassa's environment and population. Factories operated at maximum output with minimal safety considerations, and workers faced harsh quotas and brutal conditions.\n\nDespite years of occupation, the Bellassan people maintained their determination to resist. The resistance movement never ceased its activities, conducting sabotage operations, gathering intelligence, and protecting those targeted by Imperial persecution.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Imperial control weakened as forces were recalled to defend Core territories. The Bellassan resistance intensified operations, working to drive out remaining Imperial forces.\n\nFollowing liberation with support from New Republic forces, Bellassa joined the New Republic. The planet faced significant challenges rebuilding after years of Imperial exploitation, but the resilient Bellassan people worked to repair the damage and restore their world to prosperity."

901902,New, "Bescane is a terrestrial planet located in the Sesswenna sector of the Outer Rim Territories, positioned along the Hydian Way hyperlane near Eriadu. A cool, temperate world that was once covered in forests and natural beauty, Bescane has been transformed into a heavily industrialized planet dominated by the operations of Galentro Heavy Works, one of the galaxy's major manufacturing corporations.\n\nThe planet's surface is now almost entirely covered by factories, refineries, warehouses, and worker housing complexes that stretch across the landscape. The natural environment that once existed has been systematically destroyed by centuries of unchecked industrial expansion, with pollution from manufacturing operations creating a perpetual haze over many urban areas. Despite the environmental devastation, Bescane maintains a substantial population of workers drawn by employment opportunities in its massive industrial facilities.\n\nGalentro Heavy Works established its primary operations on Bescane thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, recognizing the planet's strategic location along the Hydian Way and its suitability for large-scale manufacturing. The corporation produced a wide variety of industrial equipment, construction machinery, and various mechanical components that were exported throughout the Outer Rim and beyond. Over time, Galentro's operations expanded to consume nearly the entire planet, with the corporation wielding enormous influence over planetary governance and the lives of Bescane's inhabitants.\n\nThe planet's population became severely overpopulated as Galentro recruited workers from across the Outer Rim, offering employment but providing minimal living standards. Workers and their families were housed in cramped, poorly maintained tenements built adjacent to the factories where they labored. The corporation maintained tight control over all aspects of life on Bescane, from housing and food distribution to security and local government, effectively creating a company town on a planetary scale.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Bescane remained a loyal member world, though the Galactic Republic showed limited interest in addressing the environmental degradation and labor exploitation that characterized the planet. Republic oversight of corporate practices remained minimal, allowing Galentro Heavy Works to continue its operations with few restrictions.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Bescane remained under Republic control, with Galentro Heavy Works producing equipment and supplies for the Republic war effort. The planet's strategic location along the Hydian Way made it valuable for military logistics, serving as a waypoint for Republic supply convoys moving through the Outer Rim.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Bescane came under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the planet's industrial capacity and strategic importance, establishing garrison forces to ensure continued production and maintain order among the massive worker population. Imperial oversight brought increased production quotas but little improvement in working conditions or environmental standards.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Bescane remained under firm Imperial control due to its industrial significance and position along the Hydian Way. The Empire maintained a strong presence on the planet to protect vital manufacturing facilities and ensure the continued flow of industrial equipment to Imperial forces throughout the Outer Rim.\n\nThe overpopulated conditions and harsh working environment on Bescane created discontent among the worker population, though Imperial security forces and Galentro's private security ruthlessly suppressed any signs of organized resistance. Despite this oppression, many workers secretly sympathized with the Rebel Alliance, though few dared to act on these sympathies given the risks involved.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Bescane's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of strategic industrial worlds along the Hydian Way. The planet's massive manufacturing infrastructure made it a valuable asset in the post-Imperial conflicts, with multiple factions recognizing that controlling Bescane meant controlling a significant source of industrial production in the Outer Rim."

It is also a major source of tibanna gas, which is refined for production and transport in numerous mining operations including Cloud City and Tibannopolis."
902002,New, "Bespin is a gas giant in the Anoat sector of the Outer Rim Territories, positioned along the Ison Corridor. A massive planet of primarily gaseous material orbiting a twin star system, Bespin features a habitable zone called the Life Zone where atmospheric pressure and temperature allow human habitation without protective equipment.\n\nThe Life Zone exists approximately 150-180 kilometers above the core, containing breathable air and stable conditions - rare for gas giants. Above and below lie hostile atmospheres with crushing pressures, toxic gases, and extreme temperatures.\n\nBespin is famous for vast tibanna gas deposits, valuable for industrial and military applications. Tibanna enhances blaster weapons and starship systems, naturally occurring in Bespin's atmosphere where it can be mined by facilities suspended in the Life Zone.\n\nThousands of years before the Galactic Empire, explorers discovered Bespin's tibanna reserves, attracting commercial mining operations. The most famous colony is Cloud City, built by Lord Ecclessis Figg as both a tibanna mining facility and luxury resort. This kilometer-wide platform floats at 60,000 kilometers altitude, featuring elegant architecture, casinos, and entertainment venues alongside mining operations.\n\nCloud City's upper levels host luxury hotels and tourist attractions, middle sections contain administrative spaces, while lower levels house industrial equipment and worker housing. Tibannopolis, another major facility, focuses on industrial-scale extraction.\n\nDuring the Old Republic and Clone Wars, Bespin remained largely independent and neutral, with mining operations conducting business with various factions while avoiding major conflicts.\n\nFollowing the Empire's rise, Bespin came under Imperial oversight but maintained relative independence. Lando Calrissian, winning Cloud City in a sabacc game, became Baron Administrator and kept the facility profitable while maintaining careful relations with the Empire.\n\nShortly after the Battle of Hoth, Darth Vader arrived at Cloud City, forcing Calrissian's cooperation to trap Luke Skywalker. Han Solo was frozen in carbonite, while Luke confronted Vader in a duel culminating in Vader revealing he was Luke's father. Luke refused to join the dark side, falling through the city until rescued by the Millennium Falcon.\n\nCalrissian helped Leia and Chewbacca escape and ordered Cloud City's evacuation before joining the Rebel Alliance. The Empire formally occupied the facility, using it as a strategic outpost and tibanna production center.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Cloud City remained under Imperial occupation during the Iron Blockade, which sealed the Greater Javin region. Following the blockade's collapse, various factions competed for control.\n\nCalrissian eventually returned to reclaim his position as Baron Administrator, working to rebuild Cloud City and restore its independence. Mining operations gradually resumed, ensuring Bespin's continued importance as a tibanna gas source regardless of galactic government."

902102,New, "Bilbringi is a planet located in the Inner Rim Territories, positioned along the Namadii Corridor hyperlane. An unremarkable world with modest industrial development, Bilbringi is perhaps best known for its orbital shipyards, which have served various governments throughout galactic history.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Bilbringi's shipyards remained under Republic control, contributing modestly to the war effort by producing support vessels and providing repair facilities for damaged warships. The planet's strategic location along the Namadii Corridor made it a useful waypoint for Republic supply convoys.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the end of the Clone Wars, Bilbringi's shipyards were tasked with dismantling Separatist vessels captured during the conflict. Most notably, within a year after the war's conclusion, the facility successfully dismantled the Providence-class dreadnought 'Lucid Voice', breaking down the massive warship for scrap and salvageable components.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Bilbringi remained under Imperial control, continuing its role as a minor shipyard and repair facility. The Empire used the planet's orbital facilities to service vessels operating in the Inner Rim, though it never became a major naval center.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Bilbringi's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of strategic shipyard facilities throughout the Inner Rim."

902202,New, "Bogden is a terrestrial planet located in the Inner Rim Territories, positioned along the Hydian Way hyperlane. The planet is orbited by 20 moons, creating a complex orbital system that has made the Bogden system notable among navigators and astronomers throughout galactic history.\n\nThese numerous moons, rather than the planet itself, have been the primary focus of habitation and activity in the Bogden system. Several of the larger moons support atmospheres suitable for humanoid life and have been settled over the millennia, developing their own distinct communities and cultures. The moons became known as havens for smugglers, pirates, and various criminal elements seeking to operate away from the scrutiny of galactic authorities, though legitimate settlements also exist.\n\nDuring the final years of the Galactic Republic, one of Bogden's moons became the site of a secret meeting of tremendous historical significance. Approximately ten years before the Clone Wars, the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus, publicly known as the former Jedi Master Count Dooku, traveled to this moon to meet with the renowned bounty hunter Jango Fett.\n\nThe meeting took place in a decrepit industrial facility on the moon's surface, a location chosen specifically for its isolation and lack of surveillance. Tyranus had been impressed by Fett's skills after observing the bounty hunter's work, and sought to recruit him for a crucial role in the Sith's grand plan to destroy the Jedi Order and take control of the galaxy.\n\nAt this clandestine meeting, Tyranus offered Fett an extraordinary proposition: in exchange for a substantial payment and an unaltered clone for Fett to raise as his son, the bounty hunter would serve as the genetic template for a massive clone army. This army, Tyranus explained, would be created on the remote world of Kamino by the galaxy's most skilled cloners.\n\nFett, motivated by the financial compensation and the opportunity to have an heir, accepted the offer. This decision set in motion events that would reshape the entire galaxy. The Kaminoans used Fett's genetic material to create the clone troopers who would form the Grand Army of the Republic, the massive military force that would fight throughout the Clone Wars.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Jedi Order and the Republic, this clone army had been ordered by the Sith as part of their elaborate scheme to destroy the Jedi. The clones were implanted with inhibitor chips that would later be used to execute Order 66, turning the clone soldiers against their Jedi commanders and facilitating the rise of the Galactic Empire.\n\nThe secret meeting on Bogden's moon remained unknown to galactic authorities for years. Even after the Clone Wars began and the origins of the clone army became a subject of investigation by some Jedi, the full story of how Jango Fett came to be selected as the template remained shrouded in mystery.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars themselves, the Bogden system maintained a relatively low profile, with its numerous moons continuing to serve as waypoints for smugglers and independent traders operating along the Hydian Way. The system's reputation as a haven for those operating outside the law persisted throughout this period.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Bogden fell under Imperial control like most systems along major trade routes. However, the Empire's presence in the system remained relatively minimal, with Imperial authorities focusing their attention on more strategically significant worlds along the Hydian Way. The moons of Bogden continued to harbor various criminal elements, though Imperial patrols occasionally swept through the system to suppress the most blatant illegal activities.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Bogden's status became uncertain as various factions competed for control of strategic positions along the Hydian Way. The system's numerous moons, with their complex web of settlements and their history as refuges for those seeking to avoid government oversight, made establishing clear authority over the region challenging for any government."

902302,Old, "Boonta, formerly known as Ko Vari, is a planet that had been colonised by the Hutts long ago. Despite it being a devastated world, Boonta is famous in the galaxy for its podracing and speeder races."
902302,New, "Boonta is a terrestrial planet located in the Mid Rim Territories along the Corellian Run hyperlane once known as 'Ko Vari'. However, the peaceful civilization of Ko Vari was destroyed thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire when the Hutt crime lord Boonta Hestilic Shad'ruu arrived on the planet.\n\nBoonta the Hutt was an infamous criminal who had amassed great wealth and power through his illicit enterprises. When he died, his criminal organization brought his remains to Ko Vari, where they conquered the native population and transformed the planet into a memorial to their deceased leader. The world was renamed Boonta in his honor, and the Hutts constructed massive monuments and temples dedicated to his memory.\n\nThe native Ko Vari people were enslaved or killed during the Hutt conquest, and their culture was systematically eradicated. The planet's original name and history were largely forgotten, replaced by the legacy of the Hutt gangster. Over the centuries, Boonta became deeply associated with Hutt culture, though it never achieved the prominence of Nal Hutta or Nar Shaddaa.\n\nThe Hutts transformed much of Boonta's surface through terraforming and industrial development, though large portions of the planet were left as wastelands. The world's environment suffered greatly from Hutt exploitation, with pollution and strip mining rendering many areas uninhabitable. Despite this devastation, Boonta maintained a significant population centered around the entertainment industry the Hutts developed there.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Empire, Boonta became famous throughout the Outer Rim for its podracing circuits. The dangerous, high-speed sport found a natural home on the ravaged planet, with race courses built through canyons, wastelands, and the ruins of the old Ko Vari civilization. The Boonta Eve Classic, held annually to commemorate Boonta the Hutt's ascension to godhood in Hutt religion, became one of the most prestigious podracing events in the galaxy.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Boonta maintained its status as a major podracing destination, attracting racers and spectators from across known space. The planet's economy became heavily dependent on gambling, entertainment, and the various criminal enterprises that operated openly under Hutt protection. While nominally within Republic space, Boonta effectively operated under Hutt law, with Republic authorities having minimal influence over planetary affairs.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Boonta remained under Hutt control, maintaining official neutrality while the Hutts conducted business with both the Republic and the Separatists. The planet's podracing circuits continued to operate throughout the conflict, providing entertainment and gambling opportunities regardless of the surrounding galactic turmoil.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Boonta's status remained largely unchanged. The Empire, like the Republic before it, recognized the impracticality of challenging Hutt dominance over worlds like Boonta. Emperor Palpatine negotiated agreements that allowed the Hutts to maintain control of their territories in exchange for cooperation on matters of Imperial interest.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Boonta continued to serve as a neutral ground where beings from various factions could conduct business. The planet's famous podracing events attracted audiences from throughout the galaxy, including Imperial officers, Rebel sympathizers, and independent traders, all united by their interest in the dangerous sport.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the death of Emperor Palpatine, Boonta went up for grabs as various Hutt kajidics and corporations competed for dominance in the power vacuum. The planet's podracing industry continued to thrive, with the Boonta Eve Classic maintaining its status as one of the premier sporting events in the Outer Rim."

Though it was an early member of the Republic and a longstanding and influential member of the Senate, the planet maintained neutrality during the Clone Wars. It carried this neutrality into the Imperial era, maintaining some limited autonomy from the Empire, but different Bothan clans supported either the Empire or the Rebellion, and some Rebel-aligned clans aided in the retrieval of the plans for the second Death Star."
902402,New, "Bothawui is a temperate planet in the Bothan sector of the Mid Rim, positioned along the Bothan Run hyperlane. The homeworld of the Bothan species, it features varied terrain including mountains, forests, and sprawling urban centers serving as major commercial and political hubs.\n\nBothans are humanoid beings renowned for exceptional skills in espionage, information gathering, and political maneuvering. Their culture emphasizes personal honor, clan loyalty, and accumulating prestige through cunning and strategy. ""Bothan honor"" is central to their society, with all actions - diplomatic or covert - serving to increase clan standing.\n\nThousands of years before the Empire's rise, Bothawui joined the Galactic Republic as an early member, quickly establishing itself as an important commercial center. Bothan representatives wielded considerable Senate influence due to their intelligence-gathering reputation.\n\nThe Bothan Spynet, an extensive intelligence network operated by various clans, became one of the galaxy's most effective information-gathering organizations, providing valuable intelligence to governments, corporations, and private interests.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Bothawui maintained official neutrality, refusing to commit to either Republic or Separatists. This allowed Bothans to maintain trade with both sides while spy networks gathered intelligence across the conflict, though individual clans held varying sympathies.\n\nFollowing the Empire's rise, Bothawui came under Imperial oversight but retained more autonomy than most worlds due to Bothan political savvy and the value of their intelligence networks. However, as Imperial policies grew oppressive, different clans held varying views - some collaborated while others secretly opposed the regime.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Bothawui officially remained under Imperial control, though true allegiances were complex. The Bothan Council maintained diplomatic relations with the Empire while allowing clans autonomy, providing cover for operatives working against Imperial interests.\n\nBothan involvement in the Rebellion grew significantly. Several clans committed resources to the Rebel Alliance, with spies infiltrating Imperial installations galaxy-wide.\n\nThe Bothans' most significant contribution came in obtaining the second Death Star plans. This extensive operation proved costly, with many Bothans dying to secure the intelligence. Mon Mothma's acknowledgment - ""Many Bothans died to bring us this information"" - became a somber recognition of this sacrifice.\n\nThough the Death Star intelligence was part of Emperor Palpatine's trap to lure the Rebel fleet to Endor, the Rebels ultimately prevailed, destroying the battle station and killing the Emperor.\n\nAfter Endor, Bothawui fell under Hutt Cartel influence as the New Republic struggled in the Outer Rim. The Bothan Spynet continued operating, now providing intelligence to the New Republic against Imperial remnants.\n\nThe Bothans' contributions to defeating the Empire earned them significant political capital, though their methods and willingness to engage in morally questionable activities remained controversial."

This convergence of major trade lanes has made Brentaal one of the most commercially significant worlds in the galaxy for thousands of years.\n\nThe planet's surface is almost entirely covered by sprawling cities, spaceports, and commercial infrastructure devoted to facilitating the massive volume of trade that flows through the system daily. Brentaal's economy has been built entirely around its role as a major trade hub, with countless shipping companies, trading houses, and commercial enterprises maintaining operations on the planet.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Brentaal was discovered during the early expansion of the Galactic Republic and quickly became one of the Republic's most important commercial centers. The planet joined the Republic as a founding member and maintained its loyalty for over 25,000 years, with Brentaal's representatives in the Galactic Senate wielding considerable influence due to the world's economic importance.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Brentaal developed into one of the wealthiest worlds in the Core, with fortunes made and lost daily in its bustling trading halls and commodities exchanges. The planet's strategic location ensured continuous prosperity, as virtually all trade moving between the northern and southern regions of the galaxy passed through Brentaal's system.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Brentaal remained firmly loyal to the Galactic Republic, serving as a crucial logistics hub for military supply lines. The planet's position made it strategically vital, and both Republic and Separatist forces recognized that controlling Brentaal meant controlling access to major portions of the Core Worlds. The planet saw increased military traffic throughout the war as Republic convoys moved troops and supplies through the system.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Brentaal came under Imperial control. The Empire recognized the planet's economic and strategic importance, establishing a strong garrison to maintain order and protect the vital trade routes passing through the system. Imperial oversight brought increased regulation to commerce, though Brentaal's economy continued to thrive under the new regime.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Brentaal remained under firm Imperial control for most of the conflict. The planet's strategic location made it a priority target for both sides, with the Empire maintaining substantial defensive forces to prevent any Rebel attempt to seize control of the system. The busy trade routes also made Brentaal valuable for Rebel intelligence operations, as the constant flow of commercial traffic provided cover for covert activities.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Brentaal became a major objective in the struggle between the New Republic and various Imperial remnant factions. The planet changed hands several times during fierce fighting, with both sides recognizing that controlling Brentaal meant controlling access to crucial trade routes throughout the Core Worlds. The New Republic eventually secured control of the planet, making it an important economic center for the new government."

Only discovered late during the Old Republic, it is the endpoint of the Byss Run hyperspace route after Prakith. An unusual world with an uncanny glow caused by its sun, it was considered extremely important by Emperor Palpatine."
902602,New, "Byss is a planet located deep within the galaxy's Deep Core region, positioned at Standard Galactic Grid coordinates K-11. The world serves as the endpoint of the Byss Run hyperspace route, one of the few stable passages through the treacherous Deep Core that connects the region to the wider galaxy via Prakith.\n\nByss is an unusual world characterized by an eerie, unnatural luminescence that bathes its surface in perpetual twilight. This strange glow, caused by the planet's proximity to its sun and peculiar atmospheric conditions, gives Byss an otherworldly appearance that has both fascinated and unsettled visitors throughout its history. The planet's surface features varied terrain including plains, forests, and scattered urban centers, though much of the world remained sparsely populated for millennia due to its remote location deep within the Core.\n\nFor most of galactic history, Byss remained unknown to the Galactic Republic and the wider galaxy. The Deep Core's unstable hyperspace routes, gravitational anomalies, and dense star clusters made exploration extremely dangerous, and most Republic scout missions avoided the region entirely. The few explorers who ventured into the Deep Core rarely returned, and those who did brought back only fragmentary information about the worlds they had discovered.\n\nByss was finally discovered late in the Old Republic era, when improved navigation technology and more detailed stellar cartography allowed explorers to map some of the Deep Core's treacherous hyperspace routes. The planet joined the Galactic Republic, though its extreme isolation meant that Republic influence remained minimal. Byss attracted little colonization, with only a small population of settlers establishing modest communities on the planet's surface.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Byss remained under Republic control, though its location deep within the Core meant it saw no direct involvement in the conflict. The planet continued its quiet existence, largely forgotten by the galactic community as attention focused on the war raging throughout the Outer and Mid Rim territories.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Byss's fate changed dramatically when Emperor Palpatine took a personal interest in the remote world. The Emperor recognized potential in Byss that others had overlooked - its isolation deep within the Core, its limited population, and its eerie, Force-saturated environment made it ideal for his purposes.\n\nPalpatine began secretly transforming Byss into a hidden stronghold, one of several secure locations he established throughout the galaxy as part of his contingency plans. The Emperor poured enormous resources into developing Byss, constructing massive Imperial facilities, fortifications, and research installations across the planet's surface. These projects were conducted in absolute secrecy, with even most high-ranking Imperial officials unaware of Byss's true importance.\n\nThe Emperor's interest in Byss went beyond mere military strategy. Palpatine recognized that the planet existed at a nexus of dark side energies, a confluence of Force power that could be harnessed and manipulated by one sufficiently skilled in the Sith arts. The Emperor established meditation chambers and dark side temples on Byss, using the planet as a location to conduct forbidden Sith rituals and experiments in Force manipulation.\n\nPalpatine also constructed cloning facilities on Byss, part of his long-term plan to achieve immortality through transferring his consciousness into clone bodies should his original form be destroyed. These laboratories represented some of the most advanced cloning technology in the galaxy, surpassing even the famed facilities on Kamino. The Emperor's clones were stored in massive vaults beneath Byss's surface, waiting to receive his essence should the need arise.\n\nThe native population of Byss was systematically displaced or enslaved as the Emperor's projects expanded. Those who remained on the planet were either pressed into service constructing Imperial facilities or subjected to the Emperor's dark side experiments. The Emperor's presence gradually corrupted Byss itself, with the planet's already unusual characteristics becoming even more pronounced as dark side energies saturated the world.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Byss remained one of the Empire's most closely guarded secrets. The planet's location was known only to the Emperor and his most trusted servants, with access to the Byss Run hyperspace route strictly controlled. Imperial forces stationed on Byss were selected for their absolute loyalty and were forbidden from leaving the planet or communicating with the outside galaxy.\n\nThe massive fortress complexes on Byss housed not only clone facilities and dark side temples but also vast archives containing forbidden knowledge, Sith artifacts, and the accumulated secrets of Palpatine's long reign. The Emperor intended Byss to serve as his ultimate refuge, a world so hidden and so powerful in the dark side that it would be impregnable to any threat.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's apparent death, Byss remained hidden and forgotten to the galaxy at large. Fantastical rumours of a 'Dark Empire' and a reborn Emperor belied a more banal reality, Byss is merely a deserted throneworld in a remote region of the Deep Core that never saw its intended rise to prominence."

902702,New, "Cantonica is a desert planet located in the Corporate Sector of the Outer Rim Territories. The planet's arid surface is dominated by vast salt flats and barren wastelands, creating a harsh environment inhospitable to most life. Despite these extreme conditions, Cantonica has developed into one of the galaxy's most prestigious destinations due to the presence of Canto Bight, an opulent coastal casino city built along the planet's sole body of water.\n\nCanto Bight, known as the ""playground of the galaxy,"" is an artificial oasis of luxury constructed along Cantonica's coast. The city features towering casinos, luxury hotels, and entertainment venues that cater exclusively to the galaxy's wealthiest citizens. Elaborate fountains and imported vegetation create an illusion of paradise in stark contrast to the surrounding desert.\n\nThe casino city's economy revolves entirely around high-stakes gambling and luxury tourism. Canto Bight attracts corporate executives, successful merchants, and aristocrats who have accumulated vast fortunes through various means. The city has earned a reputation as a place where credits flow freely and questions about the source of one's wealth are never asked.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Cantonica was discovered during early exploration of the Outer Rim. The planet's inhospitable environment discouraged colonization until enterprising developers recognized the potential of its coastal region. Corporate interests established Canto Bight as a luxury resort destination, investing enormous resources to create an artificial paradise for the galaxy's elite.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Canto Bight developed its reputation as neutral ground where beings from across the galaxy could conduct business regardless of their political affiliations. The Canto Bight Police Department maintained order, primarily protecting the casinos and their wealthy patrons rather than enforcing broader galactic law.\n\nBeneath Canto Bight's glamorous surface existed a darker reality. The city's stables housed fathiers, large creatures used in racing events that provided entertainment for casino patrons. These animals were often mistreated, kept in cramped conditions and subjected to brutal training. Stable workers, many of them children from impoverished backgrounds, labored in harsh conditions while the wealthy gambled above. This stark inequality was accepted as natural by Canto Bight's elite.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Cantonica maintained strict neutrality, welcoming patrons from both the Republic and the Separatists. The casino city became popular with war profiteers from both sides, who used their wealth to enjoy Canto Bight's luxuries while the galaxy burned.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Canto Bight continued operating as before, now welcoming wealthy Imperial officers and corporate executives benefiting from Imperial contracts. The casino city became particularly popular among arms dealers whose businesses thrived during the Galactic Civil War. These war profiteers accumulated vast fortunes selling weapons to the Empire.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Canto Bight adapted with characteristic pragmatism. The casino city welcomed New Republic officials while continuing to serve Imperial remnant leaders and corporate executives. As long as patrons had credits to spend, Canto Bight's casinos remained open to all. The arms dealers who had grown wealthy during the war continued to frequent the city, now selling weapons to various factions competing in the post-Imperial conflicts."

902802,New, "Celanon is a planet located in the Celanon system of the Outer Rim Territories, positioned at the strategic intersection of the Celanon Spur and several other hyperspace routes. This convergence of trade lanes has made Celanon one of the most important commercial centers in the Outer Rim for millennia, serving as a major hub for interstellar commerce and a crossroads for traders traveling between different regions of the galaxy.\n\nThe planet is the homeworld of the Nalroni species, a humanoid race known throughout the galaxy for their exceptional business acumen and shrewd negotiating skills. Nalroni culture places tremendous emphasis on commerce, with successful merchants and traders holding the highest social status. The species developed a reputation as some of the galaxy's most capable deal-makers, with Nalroni business practices and commercial law influencing trade customs throughout known space.\n\nCelanon's surface features varied terrain including urban centers, agricultural regions, and industrial zones, though the planet is best known for its massive spaceports and commercial districts. The capital city serves as a bustling trade hub where goods from across the galaxy are bought, sold, and transported to their final destinations. The spaceports operate continuously, with vessels arriving and departing at all hours as merchants conduct their business.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Celanon joined the Galactic Republic and quickly established itself as a vital economic center. The planet's strategic position made it invaluable for trade, while the Nalroni's commercial expertise ensured that Celanon remained prosperous through various galactic conflicts and political changes.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Celanon maintained steady growth as trade along the Celanon Spur and connecting routes expanded. The planet became known not just as a trade hub but as a center for commercial law and business education, with Nalroni institutions training merchants and traders from across the galaxy in the arts of negotiation and commerce.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Celanon remained officially neutral, though the planet's merchants conducted business with both the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This pragmatic approach to the conflict ensured Celanon's continued prosperity, though it also created tensions with both sides who viewed the planet's neutrality as opportunistic profiteering.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Celanon came under Imperial oversight. The Empire recognized the planet's economic importance and established a garrison to monitor trade and collect customs revenues. However, the Nalroni's commercial influence meant they retained considerable autonomy in managing their business affairs, with Imperial authorities focusing primarily on ensuring compliance with Imperial trade regulations.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Celanon remained under nominal Imperial control, though the planet's neutral merchants continued to conduct business with various factions throughout the galaxy. The busy spaceports and constant flow of commercial traffic made Celanon valuable to both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance as a source of supplies and intelligence.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Celanon's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of strategic trade routes in the Outer Rim. The planet's economic importance ensured it remained a prize worth fighting for, with the Nalroni merchants adapting to the changing political landscape while continuing their traditional commercial activities."

A lush, forested world with vast oceans and temperate climates, Celesta was discovered by early Republic explorers but remained largely unsettled for millennia due to its remote location. The planet is notable for its unique ecosystem, featuring bioluminescent flora that creates stunning natural light displays during the night cycle.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Celesta maintained strict neutrality, though both the Republic and Separatists sought to establish outposts in the system due to its strategic position along lesser-known hyperspace routes.\n\nUnder the Galactic Empire, the planet became a haven for smugglers and independent traders operating on the fringes of Imperial space."

903002,New, "Centares is a temperate planet located in the Maldrood sector of the Mid Rim Territories, positioned along the Perlemian Trade Route hyperlane. A world of varied terrain including plains, forests, and scattered urban centers, Centares developed as a modest commercial and agricultural hub due to its strategic location on one of the galaxy's most important trade routes.\n\nThe planet's surface features expansive grasslands and farming regions that produce agricultural goods for export throughout the Mid Rim. Centares maintained a relatively peaceful existence for much of galactic history, with most inhabitants living in small farming communities or working in the planet's modest spaceports and trade facilities.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Centares joined the Galactic Republic and became a waypoint for merchants traveling the Perlemian Trade Route. The planet maintained steady economic growth through agriculture and trade, though it never achieved the prominence of major commercial centers.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Centares was known for its neutrality and peaceful nature. The planet's government emphasized non-interference in galactic conflicts, preferring to focus on trade and maintaining good relations with all parties. This approach served Centares well for millennia, allowing it to prosper while avoiding entanglement in the wars that periodically swept through the galaxy.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Centares initially maintained its traditional neutrality, refusing to commit forces to either the Galactic Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet's leadership believed that remaining neutral would protect Centares from the devastation affecting so many other worlds.\n\nHowever, Centares' strategic position along the Perlemian Trade Route made neutrality difficult to maintain. Both the Republic and the Separatists recognized the value of controlling this key waypoint, and the planet inevitably became drawn into the conflict despite its government's wishes.\n\nLate in the Clone Wars, Separatist forces occupied Centares, recognizing its value for controlling traffic along the Perlemian Trade Route. The occupation proved brief but traumatic for the Centari people, who had long enjoyed peace and independence. Republic forces eventually liberated the planet, though the experience left lasting scars on Centares' traditionally neutral society.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the end of the Clone Wars, Centares came under Imperial authority. The Empire established a presence on the planet to maintain order and monitor traffic along the Perlemian Trade Route, though the garrison remained relatively modest given Centares' limited military significance.\n\nUnder Imperial rule, Centares returned to its quiet existence as an agricultural world and minor trade hub. The planet's traditional way of life continued largely unchanged, with farmers tending their fields and merchants conducting business in the spaceports much as they had for generations. The Empire's primary interest in Centares lay in its position along the trade route rather than in exploiting the planet's resources or population.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Centares remained under Imperial control, serving as a waypoint for Imperial supply convoys moving through the Mid Rim. The planet saw little direct fighting, as both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance focused their attention on more strategically significant worlds. However, many Centari privately sympathized with the Rebellion, though few dared to act on these sympathies given the Imperial presence.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Centares' status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of key positions along the Perlemian Trade Route. The planet eventually joined the Corporate Sector Authority, with its inhabitants hoping to return to the peaceful neutrality that had characterized their world before the Clone Wars.\n\nCentares' experience during the Clone Wars and under Imperial occupation taught its people that complete neutrality was impossible in an interconnected galaxy. While the planet returned to its agricultural traditions and modest commercial role, the Centari maintained a cautious awareness that their position along a major trade route would always make them vulnerable to the ambitions of galactic powers."

903102,Old, "Cerea is a planet located in the Mid Rim region of the galaxy. The homeworld of the Cerean species, Cerea is notable for its inhabitants' harmonious relationship with nature. Technology and pollution are frowned upon by the conservative government, a major point in the planet's decision not to join the Galactic Republic."
903102,New, "Cerea is a temperate planet located in the Mid Rim region along the Cerean Reach hyperlane. The homeworld of the Cerean species, characterized by their large craniums housing binary brains, Cerea has maintained a unique balance between technological advancement and environmental preservation for thousands of years.\n\nThe Cereans' binary brain structure provides exceptional mental processing capabilities, making them naturally gifted in logic, strategy, and meditation. Their society emphasizes contemplation, philosophy, and living in harmony with nature. This cultural focus made many Cereans natural candidates for the Jedi Order.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Cerea joined the Galactic Republic as a respected member world. However, the Cereans maintained fierce independence regarding planetary development. The planetary government, led by the Council of Elders, established strict regulations limiting surface technology to prevent industrial pollution and environmental degradation.\n\nCerean society is matriarchal, with females significantly outnumbering males due to an unusual birth ratio of approximately 20 females to every male. This shaped many cultural aspects, including marriage customs typically involving one male bonding with multiple female partners. The Council of Elders, composed primarily of older males who demonstrated exceptional wisdom, governed with focus on preserving traditional values and protecting the environment.\n\nThe Cereans developed the ""Outsider Citadels"" approach to technology - confining all high-technology activities to specific designated cities isolated from the rest of the planet. In these citadels, offworlders and Cereans could use advanced technology without affecting traditional settlements. This compromise allowed galactic contact while preserving pristine forests, plains, and grasslands where most Cereans lived simple lives focused on agriculture, philosophy, and communion with nature.\n\nOne of the most famous Cereans was Ki-Adi-Mundi, who served on the Jedi High Council during the Republic's final years. Master Ki-Adi-Mundi was granted a rare exception to the Jedi Code's marriage prohibition due to the Cerean species' low birth rate. He maintained families on Cerea while serving the Order, balancing duties to both his people and the Jedi.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Cerea remained loyal to the Republic, contributing primarily through diplomatic channels and Cerean Jedi like Ki-Adi-Mundi serving in leadership positions. The conservative Council of Elders worked to ensure Cerea remained insulated from the conflict.\n\nMaster Ki-Adi-Mundi served with distinction throughout the Clone Wars, but was killed when Order 66 was executed. Commander Bacara and his clone troopers turned on Ki-Adi-Mundi during the Battle of Mygeeto, eliminating one of Cerea's most prominent galactic representatives.\n\nFollowing the Empire's rise, Cerea came under Imperial authority. The Council of Elders faced a delicate challenge navigating Imperial rule, as authoritarian policies conflicted with Cerean values. However, they recognized open resistance would destroy the way of life they sought to protect. The planet's technological isolation provided some protection from Imperial exploitation.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Cerea remained officially loyal to the Empire, though many Cereans privately sympathized with the Rebel Alliance. The loss of Ki-Adi-Mundi and other Cerean Jedi during Order 66 profoundly impacted Cerean society, though the Council maintained careful political discretion.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Cerea's status became contested as various factions competed for Mid Rim influence. The Council carefully evaluated their options while maintaining their commitment to environmental preservation and contemplative philosophy."

903302,Old, "Columex, once known as Nardolin, is a planet in the Outer Rim. Originally a minor Republic outpost, it was settled by Commenorian investors in the millennia before the Clone Wars, and became a prosperous trade world on the Perlemian Trade Route. Columex seceded from the Republic during the Clone Wars, but after its fall, the planet accepted Imperial rule."
903302,New, "Columex is a terrestrial planet located in the Columex system of the Outer Rim Territories, positioned along the Perlemian Trade Route. The homeworld of the Columi species, a highly intelligent race characterized by their massive craniums and atrophied bodies, Columex has maintained a unique position in galactic history due to the exceptional intellectual capabilities of its native inhabitants.\n\nThe Columi evolved on Columex millions of years ago, developing extraordinary mental faculties while their bodies atrophied from disuse. Their civilization achieved technological advancement far earlier than most other species in the galaxy, developing space travel and exploring nearby systems long before the formation of the Galactic Republic. However, the Columi's early explorations led them to conclude that other species in the galaxy were primitive and unworthy of contact, prompting them to largely isolate themselves on their homeworld.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Columex was discovered by Republic explorers who were astounded to find a civilization that had independently developed advanced technology. The planet joined the Galactic Republic, though the Columi maintained their characteristic aloofness from galactic affairs. Despite their intellectual superiority, the Columi showed little interest in participating in Republic governance or commerce, preferring to focus on their own scientific and philosophical pursuits.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Columex attracted settlers from other worlds, particularly from Commenor, drawn by the planet's strategic location along the Perlemian Trade Route. These colonists established their own communities separate from the reclusive Columi, developing Columex into a modest trade hub. The planet's economy grew steadily through commerce, though it never achieved the prominence of major trade worlds like Corellia or Alderaan.\n\nThroughout the millennia, the Columi remained largely withdrawn from galactic society despite living on a Republic member world. They occasionally contributed their intellects to solving complex scientific or mathematical problems when approached, but generally viewed interaction with other species as beneath them. This attitude, while intellectually justified given their superior mental capabilities, created a divide between the native Columi and the growing population of offworld settlers.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Columex's status became complicated when the planet seceded from the Republic and joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The reasons for this decision remain unclear, though some historians speculate that the Columi's analytical assessment of the Republic's political situation led them to conclude that alignment with the Separatists was more logical. Alternatively, the offworld population may have driven the secession for economic reasons, with the Columi remaining characteristically uninvolved in the political decision.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the end of the Clone Wars, Columex came under Imperial control. The Empire established a presence on the planet to maintain order and ensure compliance with Imperial regulations, though the Columi's tendency toward isolation meant they posed little threat to Imperial authority. The offworld population accepted Imperial rule, and Columex continued its role as a waypoint along the Perlemian Trade Route.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Columex remained under Imperial control. The planet's strategic position made it valuable for Imperial logistics, though it never became a major battleground in the larger conflict. The Columi continued their isolated existence, largely ignoring the political upheavals that consumed much of the galaxy.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Columex's status became contested as various factions competed for control of strategic positions along the Perlemian Trade Route. The planet eventually joined the Corporate Sector Authority, though as always, the Columi themselves showed little interest in which government claimed authority over their world, remaining focused on their own intellectual pursuits while the galaxy changed around them."

Commenor's economy has long been tied to interstellar trade, with goods from across the galaxy flowing through its ports daily. The planet's position along the Commenor Run made it an essential waypoint for merchants traveling between the Core Worlds and the Outer Rim.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Commenor joined the Galactic Republic and quickly established itself as one of the Colonies' most important commercial centers. The planet maintained steady economic growth throughout the millennia, with Commenoran merchants and trading houses wielding considerable influence in regional commerce.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Commenor was known for its peaceful nature and diplomatic approach to galactic affairs. The planet's government emphasized free trade and maintained friendly relations with neighboring systems, contributing to its reputation as a stable and prosperous world.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Commenor remained loyal to the Galactic Republic, though its strategic location made it a target of interest for both sides of the conflict. The planet's busy trade routes and commercial infrastructure made it valuable for military logistics, and both Republic and Separatist forces recognized its importance. However, Commenor managed to avoid major battles, with Republic forces maintaining control throughout the war.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Commenor came under Imperial oversight. The Empire recognized the planet's economic importance and established a garrison to maintain order and protect vital trade routes. Imperial authorities implemented increased regulation of commerce passing through the system, though Commenor's economy continued to thrive under the new regime.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Commenor remained under Imperial control for most of the conflict. The planet's strategic position and economic value made it a priority for Imperial defense, with garrison forces protecting the trade routes and commercial infrastructure from Rebel attacks.\n\nHowever, as the war progressed and the Empire's authority began to fracture following the Battle of Endor, Commenor's status became increasingly contested. The planet's leadership began to question their allegiance to the crumbling Empire, and diplomatic contacts with the New Republic increased.\n\nApproximately nine years after the Battle of Endor, Commenor formally joined the New Republic. The planet's defection dealt a significant blow to Imperial remnant forces in the region, as Commenor's strategic location and economic resources provided substantial support to the New Republic's efforts to consolidate control over the Colonies.\n\nThe transition to New Republic governance proved beneficial for Commenor, as the restoration of democratic institutions and reduced military oversight allowed the planet's commercial sector to flourish even more than under Imperial rule. Commenor's ports once again became centers of free trade, with merchants from across the galaxy conducting business in an environment of reduced regulation and increased opportunity."

The planet's inhabitants developed a reputation for being tough, self-reliant frontier colonists who valued honor and justice.\n\nOne of the most famous natives of Concord Dawn was Jaster Mereel, who served as a Journeyman Protector before being exiled after killing a superior officer who he claimed was corrupt. Mereel eventually became Mand'alor, leader of the Mandalorians, and worked to reform Mandalorian culture by establishing the Supercommando Codex, a set of honorable guidelines for Mandalorian warriors.\n\nMereel's adopted son, Jango Fett, was also from Concord Dawn. After Mereel's death during the Mandalorian Civil War, Fett became one of the most renowned bounty hunters in the galaxy. Approximately ten years before the Clone Wars, Fett was selected by the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus to serve as the genetic template for the Republic's clone army, making Concord Dawn the ancestral homeworld of millions of clone troopers.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Concord Dawn remained under the control of local authorities, though its proximity to Mandalore meant it was affected by the conflicts that plagued the Mandalorian system. The planet maintained its agricultural economy throughout this period, supplying food to nearby systems.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Concord Dawn came under Imperial oversight as part of the Empire's control over the Mandalore sector. The Empire maintained a presence on the planet to ensure compliance with Imperial regulations, though local governance largely remained in the hands of planetary authorities and the Journeyman Protectors.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Concord Dawn remained under nominal Imperial control, though the planet's isolation from major conflict zones meant it saw little direct involvement in the fighting between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance.

903702,New, "Corsin is a terrestrial planet located in the Corsin system of the Expansion Region, positioned along the Corellian Trade Spine hyperlane. A world of varied terrain including mountains, forests, plains, and the infamous Agrilat Swamp, Corsin has earned galactic renown as the premier destination for swoop racing enthusiasts and professional racers.\n\nThe planet's most distinctive feature is its swoop racing culture, which has dominated Corsin's economy and identity for centuries. The Agrilat Swamp Circuit, carved through the treacherous wetlands surrounding the capital city of Cuipernam, represents one of the most dangerous and prestigious racing venues in the galaxy. The circuit's combination of natural obstacles, unpredictable terrain, and high-speed straightaways has made it a proving ground for the galaxy's most skilled swoop pilots.\n\nSwoop racing on Corsin evolved from local competitions into a massive commercial enterprise that attracts millions of spectators annually. The planet's economy revolves almost entirely around the racing industry, with hotels, casinos, repair facilities, and entertainment venues catering to racers and fans from across the galaxy. Corsin's races are broadcast throughout known space, with successful racers achieving celebrity status and lucrative sponsorship deals.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Corsin maintained membership in the Galactic Republic while developing its unique racing culture. The planet's strategic location along the Corellian Trade Spine ensured steady traffic of traders and travelers, many of whom stopped to witness the famous races.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Corsin became contested territory. Approximately two years into the conflict, Separatist forces invaded the planet, recognizing its strategic position along the Corellian Trade Spine. The Battle of Corsin saw Republic clone troopers, supported by Jedi Generals, fighting to liberate the world from Separatist occupation. The battle proved costly for both sides, with fighting damaging portions of the racing circuits and surrounding infrastructure.\n\nThe Republic ultimately reclaimed Corsin, though the occupation left scars on the planet's economy and racing industry. Many facilities required extensive repairs, and the death toll among both military forces and civilian population affected the close-knit racing community.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Corsin came under Imperial control. The Empire maintained a presence on the planet to ensure order and collect taxes from the lucrative racing industry, though Imperial authorities showed little interest in suppressing the swoop races themselves. The Empire recognized that the races served as entertainment that helped keep populations distracted from political matters.\n\nImperial oversight brought some changes to Corsin's racing culture. New safety regulations were implemented, though these were often ignored by racers and organizers alike. The Empire also used the high-profile races as opportunities for propaganda, with Imperial officials appearing at major events and Imperial sponsorship of certain racing teams.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Corsin remained under Imperial control for most of the conflict. The planet's focus on entertainment and its distance from major military objectives meant it avoided becoming a major battleground, though Imperial garrison forces maintained security throughout the war.\n\nThe swoop racing continued throughout the Galactic Civil War, with racers from various backgrounds competing regardless of political affiliations. The races provided one of the few neutral grounds where beings from different factions could gather, united by their love of high-speed competition. Some Rebel sympathizers used the large crowds and busy spaceports as cover for covert activities, though most visitors came simply to watch the races.\n\nThe Agrilat Swamp Circuit maintained its reputation as the galaxy's most challenging track, with its combination of natural hazards, sharp turns, and treacherous conditions claiming numerous racers over the years. Despite the dangers, or perhaps because of them, the circuit remained the ultimate test of swoop racing skill.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Corsin's status as a racing world ensured its continued prosperity drawing the attention of both the New Republic and Corporate Sector Authority."

Coruscant was also known as 'Imperial City' under the Galactic Empire, and 'New Republic City' under the New Republic.\n\nFamous for its cosmopolitan culture and towering skyscrapers, Coruscant's population consists of trillions of citizens hailing from a vast array of both humanoid and alien species.\n\nThough debated by historians, it is generally believed that Coruscant was the original homeworld of humanity."
903802,New, "Coruscant is a planet located in the Coruscant system of the Core Worlds region, positioned at the intersection of numerous major hyperspace routes including the Corellian Run and the Perlemian Trade Route. This strategic location has made Coruscant the political, economic, and cultural heart of galactic civilization for over 25,000 years.\n\nCoruscant is an ecumenopolis - a planet-wide city - with virtually every square meter covered by towering skyscrapers and sprawling urban infrastructure. The endless cityscape is home to trillions of beings, making it the most populous world in known space. The upper levels house the wealthy elite and government, while the lower levels are dangerous slums where sunlight never reaches and criminal organizations operate freely.\n\nThough debated by historians, Coruscant is believed to be humanity's original homeworld. The planet was one of the Core Founders of the Galactic Republic, established approximately 25,000 years before the Battle of Yavin, and served as the Republic's capital throughout its history.\n\nThe Jedi Temple, built upon an ancient Sith shrine, housed the Jedi Archives and served as the Order's headquarters. The Senate Building's massive rotunda hosted thousands of senators debating legislation and shaping galactic civilization. These structures became symbols of the Republic's ideals of peace and democracy.\n\nDuring the final decades of the Republic, corruption and gridlock paralyzed the Senate. Chancellor Palpatine rose to power promising reform. During the Clone Wars, Coruscant served as the Republic's command center. The Battle of Coruscant near war's end saw one of the largest space battles in history, culminating in Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi rescuing the kidnapped Chancellor from General Grievous.\n\nFollowing Order 66, Coruscant became capital of the Galactic Empire. Palpatine transformed it into Imperial City, converting the Jedi Temple into the Imperial Palace. The planet underwent significant changes under Imperial rule, with stark Imperial architecture replacing elegant Republic designs. The Senate was eventually dissolved, and the population swelled with Imperial bureaucrats and military personnel.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Coruscant remained the heavily fortified heart of the Empire, protected by massive defenses. The lower levels became increasingly lawless, with criminal organizations like Black Sun expanding operations. Despite the oppressive Imperial presence, resistance movements operated underground, providing intelligence to the Rebel Alliance.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Coruscant remained under Imperial control for several years as warlords competed for dominance. Approximately six years after Endor, the New Republic launched a campaign to liberate the capital. The battle proved to be one of the most significant post-Endor engagements.\n\nThe New Republic's capture of Coruscant marked a major turning point. The planet was renamed New Republic City and again became capital of a democratic government. The Imperial Palace was converted to government offices, and the Senate was reestablished.\n\nThe transition proved challenging, with millions of former Imperial personnel and divided loyalties. The lower levels remained largely ungoverned, with criminal organizations continuing their operations. Despite these challenges, Coruscant's liberation represented hope for restoring democracy and justice to the galaxy."

A remote, mysterious world far beyond the borders of known space, Crustai remained largely unknown to the Galactic Republic and most galactic governments throughout history.\n\nLittle is known about this world due to its extreme isolation in the Unknown Regions. The treacherous and unmapped hyperspace routes that characterize this region of space made exploration dangerous and unpredictable, with few vessels venturing into the area and even fewer returning with reliable data.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Crustai's existence was barely recorded in Republic star charts. The planet's remote location meant it remained unexplored and uncolonized, with no known contact between its inhabitants (if any existed) and the broader galactic community.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars and the subsequent rise of the Galactic Empire, Crustai continued its isolation in the Unknown Regions, untouched by the conflicts that engulfed much of known space.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Crustai remained one of countless worlds in the Unknown Regions that lay beyond the reach of most galactic governments. Serving as a only minor waystation for Imperial remnant forces, it leaves most of its mysteries waiting to be discovered by future explorers brave enough to venture into the uncharted depths of space."

The world features varied terrain including plains, forests, and urban centers, with a temperate climate suitable for habitation.\n\nDaalang is home to a diverse population, including the native Daal species, a reptilian humanoid race known for their craftsmanship and technical skills. The planet developed a modest industrial base, with local factories producing machinery, starship components, and consumer goods for regional markets.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Daalang maintained membership in the Galactic Republic, though its remote location kept it largely isolated from major political affairs. The planet's economy relied on manufacturing and trade along the Gamor Run, serving as a waypoint for merchants and travelers moving through the Mid Rim.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Daalang remained officially neutral, though its industrial capacity made it a target of interest for both the Republic and the Separatists. The planet avoided major battles, with local authorities working to preserve autonomy and protect their manufacturing sector from outside interference.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Daalang came under Imperial control. The Empire established a presence on the planet to oversee production and ensure compliance with Imperial regulations, though Daalang retained some local governance due to its limited strategic value. The planet's factories continued to operate, supplying equipment and components to Imperial markets while maintaining regional trade.\n\nDaalang's population adapted to changing galactic governments, focusing on industry and commerce while avoiding involvement in larger conflicts. The planet remained a minor but stable manufacturing center in the Mid Rim, with its inhabitants falling under the umbrella of the newly emboldended Hutt Cartel."

904102,Old, "Dagobah is a remote, unexplored planet in the Dagobah system, and one of the purest places in the galaxy within the Force. A remote world of swamps and forests, it served as a refuge for Jedi Grand Master Yoda during his exile after the destruction of the Jedi Order."
904102,New, "Dagobah is a remote, swamp-covered planet located in the Sluis sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Shrouded in mist and perpetually dark beneath its dense canopy, Dagobah is one of the purest places in the galaxy within the Force, though it also harbors a cave strong in the dark side.\n\nThe planet's surface is almost entirely covered in fetid swamps, bogs, and twisted forests of gnarltree and other vegetation. Dense fog blankets the landscape, and the atmosphere is thick and humid. Dagobah's ecosystem is populated by numerous creatures including bogwings, butcherbugs, dragonsnakes, and vine snakes, though no sapient species are native to the world.\n\nDagobah remained largely unknown and unexplored throughout galactic history. Its location was not recorded in most astrogation charts, and the planet's murky atmosphere interfered with sensors, making it difficult to detect from space. This isolation made Dagobah an ideal refuge for those seeking to hide from the galaxy.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, a vergence in the Force existed on Dagobah. A battle between a powerful Jedi and a dark sider resulted in the dark warrior's death within a cave, which became saturated with dark side energy and remained so for millennia afterward. This dark side cave would later serve as a test for Luke Skywalker.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Yoda experienced a Force vision on Dagobah during his investigation into the origins of the inhibitor chips implanted in the clone troopers. However, he did not remain on the planet at that time.\n\nFollowing the execution of Order 66 and the fall of the Jedi Order, Yoda fled into exile. The ancient Jedi Master chose Dagobah as his hiding place, precisely because of its isolation and its strong connection to the Force, which helped mask his presence from the Emperor and Darth Vader. Yoda constructed a simple mud hut near the dark side cave and lived there in solitude for nearly two decades.\n\nDuring his exile, Yoda waited for the day when he could train a new generation of Jedi. That day came when Luke Skywalker, following the guidance of Obi-Wan Kenobi's spirit, crashed his X-wing in Dagobah's swamps while searching for the legendary Jedi Master. Initially appearing as a simple, eccentric creature, Yoda tested Luke's patience and character before revealing his true identity and agreeing to train him in the ways of the Force.\n\nYoda trained Luke in the fundamentals of Jedi philosophy and Force techniques, though Luke's training was interrupted when he sensed his friends in danger on Cloud City. Despite Yoda's warnings, Luke departed to help them, leaving his training incomplete.\n\nLuke returned to Dagobah to complete his training, only to find Yoda dying of old age at approximately 900 years old. With his final words, Yoda confirmed that Darth Vader was indeed Luke's father and revealed that there was ""another Skywalker."" After Yoda's death, his body disappeared as he became one with the Force, leaving only his simple robes behind.\n\nFollowing Yoda's passing, Dagobah returned to its state of isolation, the mud hut slowly being reclaimed by the swamp. The dark side cave remained, a lasting testament to an ancient conflict, while the planet itself stood as a monument to one of the greatest Jedi Masters who had ever lived."

904202,New, "Dantooine is a pleasant world of grasslands, rivers and small forests located in the Raioballo sector of the Outer Rim Territories. A peaceful agricultural planet, Dantooine is home to simple farming communities and is largely ignored by the greater galaxy due to its lack of strategic importance or valuable resources.\n\nThe planet's surface consists of vast savannas dotted with sparse forests and numerous ruins dating back thousands of years. Ancient Jedi training grounds and temples can be found scattered across the landscape, remnants of a time when the Jedi Order maintained a significant presence on the world. The mild climate and fertile soil make Dantooine ideal for agriculture, with the colonists growing grains and raising livestock.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Dantooine served as the location of a Jedi Enclave, a training center established far from the Core Worlds to provide a peaceful environment for Jedi students. During the Mandalorian Wars and subsequent Jedi Civil War, the enclave became a focal point of conflict. The Sith Lord Darth Malak bombed the enclave from orbit, believing it housed a Star Map that could lead to the ancient Rakatan space station known as the Star Forge.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Jedi Enclave, Dantooine fell into obscurity once more. The planet was slowly recolonized over the following millennia, with settlers establishing small farming communities among the ancient ruins. The colonists maintained a simple existence, largely isolated from galactic politics and conflict.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Dantooine remained neutral and saw little military activity due to its remote location and lack of strategic value. The scattered farming settlements continued their quiet existence, far removed from the battles that engulfed much of the galaxy.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Dantooine's isolation could not protect it from Imperial attention. When the Rebel Alliance established a base on the planet, the Empire discovered its location. Princess Leia Organa, under interrogation aboard the Death Star, falsely claimed that the Rebel base was still on Dantooine in an attempt to save Alderaan. Grand Moff Tarkin ordered the planet destroyed anyway to demonstrate the Death Star's power, but upon arrival, Imperial forces found only the abandoned Rebel base. The planet was spared destruction, though an Imperial garrison was established to prevent the Rebellion from returning.\n\nAfter the Battle of Yavin, Dantooine remained under Imperial control, with garrison forces stationed at the former Rebel base site. The Empire maintained only minimal presence, as the planet's agricultural economy and scattered population posed no significant threat.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Endor and the fragmentation of Imperial authority, Dantooine still remained under the thumb of Imperial remnant forces. The planet's ruins attracted archaeologists and historians seeking to learn more about the ancient Jedi Order, while the farming communities continued their traditional way of life, content to remain on the fringes of galactic civilization."

Despite its grim appearance, Darkknell maintains a thriving economy based on manufacturing and trade.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Darkknell's strategic location made it a contested world between Republic and Separatist forces. The planet changed hands multiple times during the conflict, with both sides seeking to control its industrial capacity and its position along the Hydian Way.\n\nUnder the Galactic Empire, Darkknell became an important industrial center, its factories producing military equipment and supplies for the Imperial war machine. The Empire maintained a strong garrison on the planet to ensure continued production and to suppress any resistance movements among the local population."

A world of dense forests, rocky mountains, and wild grasslands, Dathomir is home to numerous dangerous predator species and a harsh, unforgiving environment.\n\nThe planet is perhaps best known as the homeworld of the Force-sensitive Witches of Dathomir, divided into various clans including the Nightsisters who practice the dark side. These matriarchal societies have developed unique Force traditions separate from both the Jedi and Sith, using techniques they call ""magicks"" to control and manipulate the Force in ways unfamiliar to the wider galaxy.\n\nDathomir's ecology includes rancors, which the Witches have learned to tame and ride, as well as countless other dangerous creatures lurking in the planet's wilderness. The males of the human population, called Nightbrothers, live separately from the female-dominated clans in a tribal warrior culture.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Dathomir was home to ancient civilizations, though much of this history has been lost to time. The planet remained isolated from the galactic community for much of its history, with its inhabitants developing independently.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, the planet drew the attention of Count Dooku and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, who sought to exploit the dark side powers of the Nightsisters. This led to conflict between the Nightsisters and the Separatists, resulting in the near-annihilation of the Nightsister clan by General Grievous and his droid army.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Dathomir fell under nominal Imperial control. However, the planet's remote location and hostile environment meant the Empire maintained only minimal oversight. Some Imperial attention was drawn to Dathomir due to rumors of Force-sensitive inhabitants, though most expeditions to the planet ended in failure.\n\nDespite the hostile environment, a few thousand human and Zabrak colonists managed to establish settlements on Dathomir, though the planet's dangerous wildlife and harsh conditions hardened most of them into fierce survivors."

A planet of varied terrain including plains, forests, mountains, and seas, Dellalt remained largely isolated from galactic affairs for much of its history.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Dellalt was part of the ancient kingdom ruled by the legendary warlord Xim the Despot. Xim used Dellalt as a repository for his vast war treasures, constructing hidden vaults deep beneath the planet's surface. After Xim's defeat at the Third Battle of Vontor, the location of these treasure vaults was lost to history, though rumors of their existence persisted for millennia.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Dellalt was settled by human colonists who established small farming communities. The planet's economy remained primarily agricultural, with most inhabitants living simple lives far removed from the political intrigues of the Core Worlds. The remote location and lack of strategic resources meant Dellalt attracted little attention from galactic governments or major corporations.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Dellalt maintained its isolation, avoiding involvement in the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. The planet's distance from major hyperspace routes and limited industrial capacity made it an unlikely target for either side.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Dellalt fell under nominal Imperial authority, though the Empire maintained only a minimal presence due to the planet's peripheral location and limited value. The Corporate Sector Authority, which controlled much of the surrounding region, showed some interest in Dellalt but never established significant operations there.\n\nShortly before the Battle of Yavin, the legendary smuggler Han Solo and his Wookiee companion Chewbacca became involved in a search for Xim's lost treasures on Dellalt. Their expedition led them into conflict with various treasure hunters and the Corporate Sector Authority, ultimately discovering one of Xim's ancient vaults. However, the treasures proved less valuable than expected, and Dellalt returned to its quiet existence.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Dellalt remained a backwater world, its inhabitants continuing their agricultural traditions while the galaxy underwent dramatic political changes around them."

This challenging climate shaped the Delrakkin into a hardy and resourceful species, well-adapted to their world's extreme conditions.\n\nDelrakkin remained isolated from the broader galactic community for much of its history, with the planet's harsh weather and remote location discouraging exploration and colonization attempts. The Delrakkin developed their own unique civilization in relative isolation, building their settlements within the mountains and jungle valleys where they could find shelter from the worst of the storms.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Delrakkin was discovered by explorers but attracted little interest due to its inhospitable environment and lack of obvious strategic or economic value. The planet maintained minimal contact with the galactic community, with the Delrakkin occasionally venturing off-world as traders or explorers, though most remained on their homeworld.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Delrakkin's isolation spared it from the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. The planet remained neutral, with its inhabitants focused on their own affairs rather than the galactic struggles that engulfed so many other worlds.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Delrakkin fell under nominal Imperial control, though the Empire showed little interest in the planet beyond ensuring basic compliance with Imperial law. The harsh environment and limited resources meant that Imperial presence remained minimal, with local Delrakkin authorities retaining considerable autonomy in managing planetary affairs.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Delrakkin remained under loose Imperial oversight, though the planet saw little direct involvement in the conflict.

The homeworld of the Kel Dor species, Dorin is a world unlike most others in the galaxy, with an atmosphere composed primarily of helium and a unique gas called Dorin gas, which is toxic to most other species but essential for Kel Dor survival.\n\nThe planet's unusual atmospheric composition means that Kel Dor must wear specialized antiox breath masks and protective goggles when traveling off-world, as oxygen-rich environments are deadly to them. This biological requirement has made the Kel Dor one of the most distinctive species in the galaxy.\n\nDorin's surface features varied terrain including mountains, forests, and plains, though much of the world remains shrouded in the planet's thick atmosphere. The Kel Dor developed a highly spiritual and philosophical society, with strong emphasis on justice and moral behavior. Their culture places great importance on family bonds and community cooperation.\n\nThe Kel Dor joined the Galactic Republic thousands of years before the rise of the Empire, becoming valued members of galactic civilization. Their natural aptitude for moral reasoning and justice made many Kel Dor ideal candidates for the Jedi Order. The Jedi Master Plo Koon, one of the most respected members of the Jedi High Council during the final years of the Republic, was perhaps the most famous Kel Dor in galactic history.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Dorin remained loyal to the Republic. The planet contributed to the war effort, with Kel Dor serving in both the Jedi Order and the Grand Army of the Republic. The Kel Dor's strong sense of justice made them natural opponents of the Separatist cause.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the execution of Order 66, Dorin fell under Imperial control. The Empire maintained oversight of the planet, though the Kel Dor's unique atmospheric requirements and relatively isolated location meant direct Imperial interference remained limited.

D'Qar's temperate climate and abundant water sources support a diverse ecosystem, though the world never developed any native sentient species. The planet's isolation from major hyperspace routes meant that few explorers or colonists ventured to this distant world.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, D'Qar was briefly notable as the site of an ancient Massassi temple. The Massassi, a fierce warrior species enslaved by the Sith, constructed several temples across various worlds in the Outer Rim. The temple on D'Qar, built in the distinctive pyramidal style characteristic of Massassi architecture, served an unknown purpose before being abandoned. Over millennia, the structure fell into ruin, gradually being reclaimed by the surrounding jungle.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, D'Qar remained uncharted and forgotten, its location known only through fragmentary ancient records that few scholars bothered to investigate. The planet's lack of valuable resources and its distance from established trade routes meant it attracted no colonization efforts or commercial interest.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, D'Qar's isolation kept it completely removed from the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet remained undisturbed, its forests and ancient ruins untouched by the warfare that consumed much of the galaxy.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, D'Qar continued its existence in obscurity.

The planet's ancient Massassi temple remained hidden beneath jungle growth, unknown to Imperial surveyors.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, D'Qar's extreme isolation meant it played no role in the conflict between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Neither side had reason to venture to the distant world, and it remained one of countless unexplored planets in the vast Outer Rim.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, D'Qar maintained its status as an uncharted, uninhabited world. The New Republic's focus on rebuilding galactic civilization and defending against Imperial remnants meant that remote planets like D'Qar received little attention. The ancient Massassi ruins continued to slowly crumble beneath the encroaching forest, while the planet itself remained pristine and undisturbed.\n\nD'Qar's isolation and the natural concealment provided by its dense forests would later make it attractive to organizations seeking to operate away from the scrutiny of galactic governments.

It hosted the Eadu Energy Conversion Laboratory prior to the outbreak of the Galactic Civil War, where Galen Erso and his team of scientists attempted to unlock the secrets of the kyber crystals as part of the Death Star project."
905202,New, "Eadu is a remote, mountainous planet located in the Outer Rim Territories, shrouded in perpetual storms and lashing rain. The planet's rugged terrain consists of towering rocky peaks and deep valleys, with constant electrical storms that make navigation treacherous. The harsh environment kept Eadu largely isolated from galactic civilization for much of its history.\n\nDuring the early years of the Galactic Empire, the planet was selected as the site for a top-secret Imperial research facility known as the Eadu Energy Conversion Laboratory. The remote location and hostile weather conditions made it ideal for concealing sensitive projects from prying eyes.\n\nThe facility was placed under the direction of scientist Galen Erso, who had been coerced into Imperial service by Director Orson Krennic. Erso and his team of researchers worked on unlocking the properties of kyber crystals, massive quantities of which were needed to power the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star. The laboratory's energy conversion research was crucial to developing the superlaser that would become the battle station's primary weapon.\n\nThe installation consisted of multiple platforms built into the mountainsides, connected by landing pads capable of receiving Imperial cargo shuttles. Despite the Empire's efforts at secrecy, Rebel intelligence eventually discovered the facility's existence and its connection to the Death Star project.\n\nShortly before the Battle of Yavin, a Rebel strike team led by Cassian Andor infiltrated Eadu during a violent storm. The mission resulted in the facility being bombed by Rebel starfighters, causing massive explosions that destroyed much of the installation. Galen Erso was mortally wounded during the attack, dying in the arms of his daughter, Jyn Erso, who had accompanied the strike team.\n\nFollowing the facility's destruction, Eadu returned to obscurity, its ruined platforms standing as a testament to the Empire's ruthless pursuit of ultimate power and the sacrifices made by those who opposed it."

It is a major supplier of carbonite to the galaxy, which makes it a center of interest and power for the Mining Guild, which controls it in all but name. First colonised by slower-than-light generation ships in the millennia before the founding of the Galactic Republic, Empress Teta has had a tumultuous history, from the Krath Holy Crusade into the Clone Wars, where its control by the Mining Guild led to it joining the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the age of the Galactic Empire, Empress Teta was a security checkpoint into the Deep Core."
905402,New, "Empress Teta, originally known as Koros, is a city-covered planet located in the Deep Core region of the galaxy. The world is renowned for its ecumenopolis surface, with the capital city Cinnagar serving as the political and cultural heart of the system. Empress Teta is one of the few Deep Core worlds accessible via stable hyperspace routes, making it a major hub for trade and travel in the region.\n\nThe planet was first settled by generation ships thousands of years before the founding of the Galactic Republic. The Koros system was unified under the rule of Empress Teta, who led a campaign to bring peace and prosperity to the region. Her reign marked the beginning of the planet's rise as a center of civilization and commerce.\n\nDuring the Great Hyperspace War, Empress Teta played a pivotal role as a battleground between the Sith Empire and the forces of the Republic. The planet was invaded by Sith forces led by Naga Sadow, but the defenders, including Jedi and local military, ultimately repelled the attack, preserving the system's independence.\n\nCenturies later, Empress Teta became the birthplace of the Krath, a dark side cult founded by Satal Keto and Aleema Keto. The Krath seized control of the planet and launched the Krath Holy Crusade, challenging both the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic. The conflict saw significant battles on Empress Teta, including the involvement of Ulic Qel-Droma and Exar Kun during the Great Sith War.\n\nThroughout the Old Republic era, Empress Teta remained a major urban and industrial center, known for its production of carbonite and other valuable resources. The planet's strategic location and economic importance made it a frequent target for political intrigue and military campaigns.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Empress Teta joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, influenced by the Mining Guild and local interests.

Once a regional headquarters for the Trade Federation, it served as a staging point for the fleet of warships that blockaded Naboo, a decade before the Clone Wars. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire, Enarc was Imperialized, and transformed into an Imperial Army transport and supply depot."
905502,New, "Enarc is a terrestrial planet located in the Kira system of the Borderland Regions in the Outer Rim Territories. A world of varied terrain including plains, forests, and urban centers, Enarc developed into a significant commercial hub due to its strategic position at the intersection of multiple hyperspace routes including the Kira Run.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Enarc was discovered during the early expansion of the Galactic Republic. The planet joined the Republic and developed steadily over millennia, establishing itself as a regional trade center. Its location made it valuable for merchants and shipping companies moving goods between different regions of the Outer Rim.\n\nDuring the final decades of the Galactic Republic, Enarc came under the influence of the Trade Federation, one of the galaxy's most powerful commercial organizations. The Trade Federation established a significant presence on the planet, using it as a regional headquarters and staging point for their commercial fleet operations. The planet's strategic location and developed infrastructure made it ideal for coordinating Trade Federation activities throughout the surrounding sectors.\n\nApproximately 32 years before the rise of the Empire, the Trade Federation used Enarc as a staging area when assembling the fleet that would blockade and invade Naboo. The massive concentration of Trade Federation battleships and support vessels at Enarc went largely unnoticed by Republic authorities, demonstrating both the Federation's power and the Republic's inability to effectively monitor corporate military buildups.\n\nFollowing the failed invasion of Naboo, the Trade Federation maintained its operations on Enarc despite increased Republic scrutiny. When Count Dooku founded the Confederacy of Independent Systems a decade later, the Trade Federation joined the Separatist movement, and Enarc became part of Separatist-controlled space.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Enarc served as an important logistics hub for Separatist forces operating in the Outer Rim. The planet's infrastructure, built up by the Trade Federation over decades, proved valuable for coordinating military operations and managing supply lines. Republic forces launched several campaigns to contest control of Enarc, recognizing its strategic importance.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the end of the Clone Wars, Enarc came under Imperial control. The Empire recognized the planet's value as a logistics center and moved quickly to seize Trade Federation assets and infrastructure. Imperial authorities reorganized Enarc's facilities, transforming the former Trade Federation headquarters into an Imperial Army transport and supply depot.\n\nUnder Imperial rule, Enarc became a major military logistics hub for operations in the Outer Rim. The Empire established extensive warehouses, vehicle depots, and troop barracks across the planet's surface. Imperial Army units used Enarc as a staging point before deployment to conflict zones, while supply convoys regularly departed from the planet carrying equipment and provisions to Imperial garrisons throughout the region.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Enarc remained under firm Imperial control due to its strategic importance. The Empire maintained a substantial garrison to protect the valuable supply depot and ensure the continued flow of military equipment to Imperial forces throughout the Outer Rim. The planet's role as a transport hub made it a tempting target for Rebel operations, though the strong Imperial presence deterred direct attacks.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Enarc's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of strategic logistics centers in the Outer Rim. The planet's warehouses and transport infrastructure made it a valuable prize, with multiple factions recognizing that controlling Enarc would significantly enhance their ability to supply and deploy forces throughout the region."

905602,Old, "Endor is a forested moon in the Outer Rim. Home to a variety of species, including the predatory Ewoks, it has been a relatively isolated section of the galaxy for thousands of years. However, it is also known for the many shipwrecks that have crashed there over the millennia. The Empire used Endor as the construction site for the second Death Star, and installed a shield generator on the surface to protect the battlestation. Four years after the destruction of the first Death Star, the Rebel Alliance engaged the Imperial Navy in the Battle of Endor, destroying the Death Star and killing the Emperor."
905602,New, "Endor, also known as the ""sanctuary moon,"" is a small forested moon orbiting the gas giant Endor in the Moddell sector of the Outer Rim Territories. The moon's surface is covered in dense temperate forests, featuring towering trees, ferns, and varied terrain including plains, savannas, deserts, and mountain ranges. Despite its remote location, Endor harbors a remarkably diverse ecosystem.\n\nThe moon is home to numerous species, most notably the Ewoks, small furry bipeds who live in primitive tribal villages built high in the forest canopy. Despite their diminutive size and Stone Age technology, the Ewoks are intelligent, resourceful, and fiercely protective of their forest home. Other native species include the hulking gorax, spotted pony-like bordoks which Ewoks use as mounts, and various predators lurking in the wilderness.\n\nFor thousands of years, Endor remained largely isolated from galactic civilization. Its remote location and lack of obvious resources meant few explorers ventured to the moon, though occasional starships crashed on its surface over the millennia, leaving behind wreckage scattered throughout the forests. Some of these ancient crash sites became sacred places or sources of salvaged technology for the native Ewoks.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the Empire selected Endor as the construction site for the second Death Star. The moon's isolation made it ideal for concealing the massive project from Rebel intelligence. Imperial engineers constructed a sophisticated SLD-26 planetary shield generator on Endor's surface, protected by a substantial garrison of Imperial troops including scout troopers and AT-ST walkers. This shield projected a protective field around the incomplete Death Star in orbit, making the battle station invulnerable to direct attack.\n\nApproximately four years after the Battle of Yavin and the destruction of the first Death Star, Rebel intelligence discovered the second Death Star's location above Endor. The Alliance planned a two-pronged assault: a commando team would infiltrate the forest moon to disable the shield generator while the Rebel fleet attacked the Death Star directly.\n\nThe strike team, led by General Han Solo and including Princess Leia Organa, Chewbacca, and Luke Skywalker, arrived on Endor aboard a stolen Imperial shuttle. Shortly after landing, they encountered the Ewoks. Initial contact proved tense, with the primitives nearly cooking several team members before C-3PO convinced them the Rebels were allies by recounting stories of their struggles against the Empire.\n\nThe Ewoks, led by Chief Chirpa, agreed to help the Rebels after learning of the Empire's presence on their moon. When the strike team attempted to infiltrate the shield generator bunker, they were captured by Imperial forces who had been expecting them, having been lured into a trap as part of Emperor Palpatine's plan to destroy the Rebellion.\n\nHowever, the Ewoks launched a surprise attack on the Imperial garrison, using their knowledge of the forest terrain and primitive but effective weapons and tactics. Despite suffering casualties from Imperial firepower, the Ewoks' guerrilla warfare proved remarkably effective. They destroyed several AT-ST walkers using logs, rocks, and other improvised weapons, and their superior mobility in the forest environment allowed them to outmaneuver the Imperial forces.\n\nThe Ewok assault created enough chaos for the Rebel commandos to break free and seize control of the shield generator facility. Han Solo's team successfully destroyed the generator, bringing down the protective shield around the Death Star. This allowed the Rebel fleet, engaged in desperate space battle above, to launch their assault run into the Death Star's superstructure.\n\nIn orbit, Admiral Ackbar's fleet engaged the Imperial Navy while Lando Calrissian and Wedge Antilles led starfighters into the Death Star's incomplete sections. Simultaneously, aboard the battle station, Luke Skywalker confronted Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine. In the throne room, Vader ultimately turned against his master to save his son, hurling Palpatine down a reactor shaft. The Emperor's death and Vader's redemption fulfilled the prophecy of the Chosen One bringing balance to the Force.\n\nLando and Wedge successfully fired proton torpedoes into the Death Star's main reactor, triggering a chain reaction. The massive battle station exploded in a spectacular fireball visible from Endor's surface, marking the Empire's greatest defeat and the beginning of its eventual collapse.\n\nFollowing the battle, the Ewoks celebrated with the Rebels in their treetop villages, honoring the heroes who had helped liberate their moon from Imperial occupation. The destruction of the Death Star and the Emperor's death sent shockwaves throughout the galaxy, inspiring hope in oppressed populations and emboldening resistance movements across countless worlds.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, the moon became a symbol of the Rebellion's triumph and the turning point in the Galactic Civil War. Debris from the destroyed Death Star remained in orbit and scattered across Endor's surface, including fragments that would be salvaged or studied in subsequent years.\n\nThe New Republic established a small observational presence in the Endor system, though they largely left the Ewoks to govern themselves. The primitive species had proven their worth as warriors and allies, earning the respect of the galactic community. Some Ewoks maintained contact with their Rebel friends, while others returned to their traditional way of life in the forest canopy, content to live as their ancestors had for generations."

905702,New, "Esfandia is a remote ice planet located in Wild Space, positioned along the border between the known galaxy and the Unknown Regions. A frozen world perpetually shrouded in blizzards and ice storms, Esfandia's surface is covered in vast glaciers, frozen tundra, and jagged ice formations that create a harsh and inhospitable environment.\n\nDespite its extreme conditions, Esfandia is home to several native species that have adapted to the planet's frozen climate. The most notable of these are the Lugubraa, a peaceful sentient species whose culture centers around artistic expression and communal living within ice caves carved into the planet's glaciers. The Lugubraa developed a sophisticated society despite their isolation, creating intricate ice sculptures and maintaining oral traditions passed down through countless generations.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Esfandia was discovered by Republic explorers charting Wild Space. The planet's extreme environment and remote location meant it attracted little colonization, though the Republic recognized its potential strategic value due to its position near the Unknown Regions.\n\nThe Galactic Republic established a HoloNet relay station on Esfandia, recognizing that the planet's location made it ideal for extending communications into previously unreachable regions of space. This relay represented one of the Republic's most remote communications outposts, allowing limited HoloNet coverage to extend beyond the traditional boundaries of known space. The installation required specialized equipment to function in Esfandia's harsh climate, with most of the facility constructed beneath the ice to protect it from the planet's violent storms.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Esfandia remained a quiet backwater world, its HoloNet relay maintained by a small contingent of Republic technicians who lived in isolation from the rest of the galaxy. The native Lugubraa maintained peaceful relations with these offworlders, occasionally trading with them but generally keeping to their traditional way of life deep within their ice caves.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Esfandia's isolation spared it from direct involvement in the conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet continued its quiet existence, with the HoloNet relay continuing to operate and extend communications into Wild Space and beyond.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Esfandia came under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the strategic value of the planet's HoloNet relay and maintained the installation, using it to monitor communications in the Unknown Regions and track potential threats from beyond known space. Imperial personnel replaced Republic technicians, though the harsh conditions meant the garrison remained small.\n\nApproximately three years after the Battle of Yavin, Esfandia became the site of a significant engagement during the Galactic Civil War. The Empire, seeking to develop new weapons technology, established a secret research facility on the planet to work on advanced shield systems and other military projects. The isolation and harsh environment made Esfandia an ideal location for such classified work.\n\nRebel Alliance intelligence discovered the Imperial research facility and launched an operation to investigate its activities. The mission brought Rebel operatives into contact with both Imperial forces and the native Lugubraa, whose peaceful existence was being disrupted by the Imperial presence and the military operations occurring on their world.\n\nThe engagement on Esfandia highlighted the planet's vulnerability despite its remote location. The battle saw fighting across the frozen surface as Rebel and Imperial forces clashed, with the harsh environment proving as dangerous as enemy fire. The native Lugubraa, caught in the crossfire of galactic conflict, suffered casualties despite their attempts to remain neutral.\n\nFollowing the battle, the Empire maintained its presence on Esfandia, though on a reduced scale. The HoloNet relay continued to operate throughout the Galactic Civil War, providing the Empire with communications coverage into the Unknown Regions. The research facility's status following the engagement remained classified, though Imperial authorities increased security measures to prevent future Rebel incursions.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Imperial control over Esfandia weakened as forces were recalled to defend Core Imperial territories. The HoloNet relay became contested, with both Imperial remnants and the New Republic recognizing its strategic value for extending communications into Wild Space and the Unknown Regions.\n\nThe native Lugubraa, having endured years of occupation and conflict, worked to rebuild their communities and return to their traditional way of life. The ice caves that had sheltered their civilization for millennia continued to provide refuge, though the scars of war and Imperial exploitation would take generations to fully heal."

905802,New, "Exodeen is a terrestrial planet located in the Colonies region of the galaxy, positioned along the Hydian Way hyperlane. One of the earliest worlds colonized along this vital trade route, Exodeen developed into a significant commercial and cultural center during the Old Republic era.\n\nThe planet is home to the native Exodeenian species, a humanoid race known for their adaptability and strong sense of civic duty. Exodeenian society placed great emphasis on education, public service, and participation in galactic affairs. Their culture produced many skilled administrators, diplomats, and military officers who served throughout the galaxy.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Exodeen was among the first worlds colonized along the Hydian Way during the Republic's early expansion. The planet quickly became an important waypoint for trade and travel, benefiting from its strategic position along one of the galaxy's busiest hyperspace routes. Exodeen joined the Galactic Republic as a founding member and maintained unwavering loyalty for over 25,000 years.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Exodeen flourished as a center of commerce and culture. The planet's cities featured impressive architecture blending traditional Exodeenian design with influences from across the galaxy. Educational institutions on Exodeen earned reputations for excellence, producing graduates who went on to serve in the Republic's diplomatic corps, military, and administrative bureaucracy.\n\nExodeenians became known throughout the galaxy for their reliability and dedication to public service. Many left their homeworld to pursue careers in Republic government, with Exodeenian senators, ambassadors, and civil servants playing important roles in galactic governance. This tradition of service became deeply ingrained in Exodeenian culture, with families taking pride in members who distinguished themselves in Republic service.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Exodeen remained steadfastly loyal to the Galactic Republic. The planet contributed both resources and personnel to the war effort, with many Exodeenians serving in the Grand Army of the Republic and in various administrative capacities supporting the military campaign against the Separatists. The planet's position along the Hydian Way made it valuable for Republic logistics and supply lines.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Exodeen came under Imperial control. The transition from Republic to Empire proved deeply troubling for many Exodeenians, whose cultural values emphasized democratic participation and civic responsibility. However, the planet's long tradition of government service meant that many Exodeenians found themselves serving the new regime, often in the same bureaucratic positions they had held under the Republic.\n\nExodeenian administrators, diplomats, and military officers became fixtures within Imperial bureaucracy. Their reputation for competence and reliability ensured they remained valued by Imperial authorities, even as many privately harbored doubts about the Empire's authoritarian policies. Some Exodeenians embraced the New Order, believing the Empire's promise of stability and security, while others served reluctantly, viewing their positions as opportunities to moderate Imperial excesses from within.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the Exodeenian population found itself divided in loyalty. While Exodeen officially remained under Imperial control, many citizens grew increasingly disillusioned with the Empire's oppression and brutality. The destruction of Alderaan particularly shocked Exodeenian society, as it represented the ultimate betrayal of the values many Exodeenians had served throughout their careers.\n\nNumerous Exodeenians defected to the Rebel Alliance, bringing with them valuable knowledge of Imperial bureaucracy and military organization. These defectors provided crucial intelligence and expertise to the Rebellion, using their understanding of Imperial systems to help the Alliance strike effectively at the Empire. Exodeenian rebels served in various capacities, from intelligence analysis to military command to diplomatic missions.\n\nThe division in Exodeenian society reflected the broader galactic struggle, with families sometimes torn apart by conflicting loyalties. Some Exodeenians remained in Imperial service out of genuine belief in the Empire's mission, while others stayed because they felt duty-bound to their positions or feared the consequences of defection. Meanwhile, their relatives and former colleagues fought against the Empire with equal conviction.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Exodeen joined the new government. The planet's population, relieved by the Empire's defeat, worked to rebuild democratic institutions and restore the values that had defined Exodeenian culture during the Republic era. Many Exodeenians who had served the Empire sought redemption by dedicating themselves to the New Republic's success.\n\nExodeenian expertise in administration and governance proved valuable to the New Republic as it struggled to establish effective government across liberated territories. The planet's tradition of public service continued, with a new generation of Exodeenians leaving their homeworld to help build a better galaxy. The lessons learned during the dark years of Imperial rule reinforced Exodeenian commitment to democratic principles and the importance of remaining vigilant against tyranny."

The planet maintained steady economic growth throughout the millennia, with its shipyards and manufacturing facilities producing vessels and equipment for both civilian and military use.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Fedalle was known for its reliable industrial output and its position as a major trade hub connecting different regions of the Core Worlds. The planet's economy benefited from the constant flow of merchant traffic along the Hydian Way, establishing Fedalle as a prosperous and strategically valuable world.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Fedalle remained firmly loyal to the Galactic Republic. The planet's shipyards contributed vessels to the Republic Navy, while its factories produced military equipment and supplies for the Grand Army of the Republic. Fedalle's strategic location made it an important logistics hub for Republic forces operating throughout the Core Worlds.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Fedalle came under Imperial control. The Empire recognized the planet's industrial capacity and strategic position, maintaining a significant garrison to protect vital shipyards and manufacturing facilities. Imperial oversight brought increased regulation to the planet's industrial sector, with production quotas enforced to ensure continued supply of military hardware.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Fedalle remained under Imperial control for most of the conflict. The planet's proximity to Coruscant and its industrial importance made it a priority for Imperial defense. However, as the war progressed and Imperial authority began to fracture following the Battle of Endor, Fedalle's status became increasingly contested.\n\nApproximately seven years after the Battle of Endor, Fedalle became the site of a significant engagement between New Republic and Imperial forces. The planet had remained under Imperial control despite the Empire's defeats elsewhere, with Imperial commanders recognizing its strategic value for maintaining a presence in the Core Worlds.\n\nThe New Republic launched a campaign to liberate Fedalle, seeking to secure the planet's shipyards and deny them to Imperial remnant forces. The battle saw intense fighting both in space and on the planet's surface, with New Republic forces ultimately succeeding in capturing the world. The liberation of Fedalle dealt another blow to Imperial authority in the Core Worlds and provided the New Republic with valuable industrial facilities.\n\nFollowing its liberation, Fedalle joined the New Republic.

One of the most verdant and lush worlds in the galaxy, Felucia's surface is covered by dense fungal forests, bioluminescent plants, and exotic flora that create a landscape unlike any other in known space.\n\nThe planet's ecosystem is dominated by massive fungi that tower hundreds of meters into the air, creating a multi-layered canopy filled with strange and often dangerous creatures. The flora and fauna of Felucia have evolved in remarkable ways, with many organisms displaying brilliant colors and bioluminescent properties. The entire planet is saturated with the Force, creating a living environment where the boundary between plant and animal life often blurs.\n\nFelucia is home to several sentient species, including the Felucians, a primitive amphibian species who live in tribal communities within the jungle. The Felucians developed a shamanic culture centered around their connection to the Force and the planet's natural rhythms. They are sensitive to the Force and capable of using it to influence the growth of Felucia's plants and to bond with the planet's creatures.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Felucia was colonized by the Gossam species, who recognized the planet's potential for agricultural production despite its challenging environment. The Commerce Guild, controlled by the Gossam, established operations on Felucia to harvest the planet's unique plant life for pharmaceutical and agricultural exports. However, the native Felucians continued to inhabit the deep jungles, maintaining their traditional way of life.\n\nFor much of its history, Felucia remained under Commerce Guild control, with the Gossam maintaining plantations and processing facilities in cleared areas while the Felucians lived in the untamed wilderness. The planet joined the Galactic Republic only decades before the Clone Wars, remaining a frontier world with limited Republic oversight.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Felucia became contested when the Commerce Guild joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet's strategic position along the Perlemian Trade Route and its agricultural resources made it valuable to both sides. Republic forces launched several campaigns to secure Felucia, leading to some of the most brutal jungle warfare of the entire conflict.\n\nThe Battle of Felucia saw Republic clone troopers fighting through dense vegetation against Separatist battle droids and organic forces. The planet's hostile environment proved as dangerous as enemy fire, with poisonous plants, aggressive predators, and treacherous terrain claiming casualties on both sides. Jedi Generals including Aayla Secura led Republic forces in multiple engagements across Felucia's surface.\n\nNear the end of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Aayla Secura was stationed on Felucia with her clone trooper battalion. When Order 66 was executed, Commander Bly and his troops turned on their Jedi General, killing her in the jungle. Secura's death on Felucia was one of countless tragedies that marked the end of the Jedi Order.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Felucia came under Imperial control. The Empire maintained a garrison on the planet to protect Commerce Guild operations and ensure continued production of agricultural exports. However, the dense jungles and hostile wildlife made complete Imperial control difficult to enforce.\n\nDuring the early years of Imperial rule, a group of former Jedi and Force-sensitives sought refuge on Felucia, hoping the planet's strong Force presence would help conceal them from the Empire. These survivors attempted to live in harmony with the native Felucians, though their presence eventually drew Imperial attention.\n\nImperial forces conducted periodic sweeps through Felucia's jungles, hunting for hidden Jedi and suppressing any resistance from the native population. The Felucians, protective of their jungle home, occasionally came into conflict with Imperial forces, using their knowledge of the terrain and ability to command local creatures to resist occupation.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Felucia remained under Imperial control for most of the conflict. The planet's isolation and challenging environment meant it saw limited Rebel Alliance activity, though the dense jungles occasionally provided refuge for Alliance operatives operating in the region.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Felucia's fell under Corporate Sector Authority influence as they worked to expand their claims in the Outer Rim. The native Felucians continued their existence in the deep jungles, largely unaffected by the changing galactic governments, maintaining their ancient connection to the Force and the living world of Felucia."

906102,Old, "Firrerre is a world in the Outer Rim. Once home to the Firrerro people, it is now a barren world, all of its life having been eradicated by the Empire with a lethal virus."
906102,New, "Firrerre is a terrestrial planet located in the Abrion sector of the Outer Rim Territories. The homeworld of the Firrerreo species, a near-human race known for their distinctive two-toned hair, golden skin, and exceptional longevity, Firrerre was once a world of considerable beauty and cultural richness.\n\nThe Firrerreo evolved as a long-lived species, with lifespans extending for centuries. Their culture emphasized artistic expression, philosophy, and the careful cultivation of knowledge across generations. Firrerreo society placed great value on memory and oral tradition, with their people serving as living repositories of their civilization's history.\n\nOne distinctive aspect of Firrerreo biology was their unusual relationship with their names. A Firrerreo who heard their full name spoken aloud would become weakened and vulnerable. This biological quirk shaped their culture profoundly, with true names kept as closely guarded secrets. Most Firrerreo used pseudonyms or partial names in daily life.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Firrerre maintained membership in the Galactic Republic, though remained relatively isolated due to its remote location. The Firrerreo's long lifespans meant their civilization developed slowly, with cultural changes occurring over centuries rather than decades. However, this allowed Firrerreo scholars and artists to dedicate lifetimes to perfecting their crafts, producing works of exceptional quality.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Firrerre remained under Republic control, its remote location sparing it from major battles.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Firrerre's fate took a dark turn. The Empire targeted the Firrerreo species for extermination, deploying a biological weapon against the planet. The Candorian plague, a genetically-engineered virus designed to target Firrerreo biology, swept across the planet with devastating efficiency, killing most of the population within months.\n\nThe plague spread rapidly through Firrerreo communities. Infected individuals developed severe symptoms quickly, with death following within days. Medical facilities were overwhelmed, and quarantine measures proved ineffective. As the death toll mounted, Firrerre's cities became mass graves. The Firrerreo's rich culture, accumulated over thousands of years, was extinguished in a biological holocaust.\n\nA handful of Firrerreo survived, primarily those offworld when the virus was released. These survivors found themselves scattered across the galaxy, the last remnants of a once-thriving civilization. Many went into hiding, fearful the Empire might hunt down survivors.\n\nFollowing the plague, Firrerre was left a dead world. The Empire established a quarantine zone, preventing investigation and concealing evidence of their crime. The planet's cities stood as silent monuments to genocide, slowly decaying without maintenance.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Firrerre remained under Imperial quarantine. The Empire maintained patrol vessels to enforce the exclusion zone. Rumors of the genocide spread through Rebel Alliance intelligence networks, though concrete evidence remained elusive.\n\nThe few surviving Firrerreo struggled to maintain their cultural identity while living in exile. Cut off from their homeworld and lacking critical mass to sustain traditions, many aspects of Firrerreo culture began to fade. Some survivors worked to document what they remembered, desperate to preserve something of their civilization.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, the truth about Firrerre began to emerge as Imperial files were uncovered. The New Republic investigated and officially recognized the genocide as one of the Empire's most heinous crimes.\n\nHowever, investigation of Firrerre itself remained dangerous due to potential contamination. The New Republic maintained the quarantine while scientists studied whether the pathogen remained active. The planet stood as a grim memorial to Imperial cruelty.\n\nThe surviving Firrerreo, numbering perhaps only in the hundreds across the galaxy, worked to rebuild some semblance of community while mourning their loss. Their long lifespans meant many survivors would carry the memory of Firrerre's destruction for centuries, living witnesses to genocide who would ensure their people's fate would not be forgotten."

It lies at the meeting point of the Corellian Trade Spine hyperroute and the Shipwright's Trace.\n\nA world of vast oceans and scattered island continents, Foless was settled by human colonists during the early expansion era of the Old Republic. The planet became known for its shipbuilding facilities, taking advantage of its strategic location along major trade routes.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Foless remained loyal to the Republic and served as a minor naval staging point.\n\nUnder the Galactic Empire, the planet's shipyards were pressed into service constructing Imperial vessels, though on a smaller scale than major yards like Kuat or Corellia.\n\nThe native Foless were incorporated into galactic society, though they maintained their traditional seafaring culture alongside modern starship construction. The planet's economy relied heavily on maritime industries and its position as a waypoint for traders moving between the Core and the Colonies."

906302,Old, "Fondor is a planet in the Colonies region. A heavily industrialised ecumenopolis, Fondor is one of the most prominent starship manufacturers in the galaxy, outclassed only by Corellia and Kuat. During the Clone Wars, it was ostensibly a member of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, but most of its population was unsupportive of the Separatist cause, and contributed little to the war effort. During the age of the Galactic Empire, Fondor's shipyards were used for classified research and development."
906302,New, "Fondor is a heavily industrialized planet located in the Tapani sector of the Colonies region, positioned along the Rimma Trade Route hyperlane. One of the galaxy's most important shipbuilding centers, Fondor rivals Corellia and Kuat as a premier manufacturer of starships, with its massive orbital shipyards producing vessels for various governments throughout galactic history.\n\nThe planet's surface is almost entirely covered by urban sprawl, factories, and industrial infrastructure devoted to starship construction and related industries. Fondor Shipyards, the planet's primary manufacturing concern, operates massive orbital construction facilities capable of building capital ships of all sizes. The shipyards have produced some of the most iconic vessels in galactic history, establishing Fondor's reputation for quality engineering and innovative designs.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Fondor joined the Galactic Republic and quickly became one of its most important industrial centers. The planet's strategic location along the Rimma Trade Route ensured steady economic growth, with Fondor's shipyards producing both civilian and military vessels for Republic use throughout the millennia.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Fondor maintained its position as a leading shipbuilding world, competing with Corellia and Kuat for lucrative contracts. The planet's economy became intrinsically tied to starship construction, with most of the population employed in the shipyards or supporting industries. Fondor's industrial capacity proved crucial during various galactic conflicts, providing the Republic with much-needed warships.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Fondor's allegiance became complicated. The planet officially joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, though this alignment was driven more by economic interests and political pressure than genuine support for the Separatist cause. Much of Fondor's population remained sympathetic to the Republic, creating internal divisions that limited the planet's contribution to the Separatist war effort.\n\nDespite official Separatist control, production at Fondor's shipyards remained relatively limited during the Clone Wars compared to other major industrial worlds. The workforce's reluctance to fully support the Confederacy, combined with Republic efforts to disrupt operations, meant that Fondor never became the Separatist powerhouse that Count Dooku had hoped for.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the end of the Clone Wars, Fondor came under Imperial control. The Empire recognized the planet's strategic value and moved quickly to secure its shipyards and industrial infrastructure. Imperial authorities reorganized Fondor's manufacturing facilities, pressing them into service producing vessels for the rapidly expanding Imperial Navy.\n\nUnder Imperial rule, Fondor became one of the Empire's most important naval construction centers. The planet's shipyards produced Star Destroyers, support vessels, and various other military craft throughout the Imperial era. The Empire maintained a strong military presence on Fondor to protect the valuable facilities and ensure continued productivity.\n\nFondor's shipyards were also used for classified research and development projects during the Imperial era. The Empire established secure facilities within the orbital yards where experimental technologies and prototype vessels could be developed away from prying eyes. These classified programs contributed to the development of various Imperial military innovations.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Fondor remained under firm Imperial control due to its strategic importance. The planet's shipyards continued producing vessels for the Imperial Navy throughout the conflict, making Fondor a priority target for Rebel operations. However, the strong Imperial garrison and orbital defenses deterred direct Rebel attacks on the facilities.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Fondor's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of the valuable shipyards. The planet changed hands several times during the conflicts that followed, with different factions recognizing that controlling Fondor meant controlling a significant portion of the galaxy's military shipbuilding capacity.\n\nApproximally 12 years after the Battle of Endor, the New Republic finally secured control of Fondor, though Imperial remnant forces continued to contest the planet's allegiance. The shipyards were converted to produce vessels for the New Republic Defense Fleet, continuing Fondor's long tradition as one of the galaxy's premier centers of starship construction."

906402,Old, "Fusai is a planet in the Outer Rim. It was home to a branch of the Celebratus Archive of Obroa-skai, but once Obroa-skai abandoned the branch, it was maintained locally. Fusai was a Rebel safe world during the age of the Empire, and a supercomputer in the library aided the Rebels in tactical and strategic planning."
906402,New, "Fusai is a terrestrial planet located in the Outer Rim Territories. A world of varied terrain including forests, plains, and scattered urban centers, Fusai developed as a modest center of learning and scholarship, though it remained largely isolated from major galactic affairs for much of its history.\n\nThe planet's most notable feature is its library, a branch facility of the renowned Celebratus Archive originally established by scholars from Obroa-skai. For thousands of years, this repository of knowledge served researchers and students throughout the region, maintaining extensive collections of texts, data, and historical records.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Fusai maintained its connection to Obroa-skai's vast archive network, receiving regular updates and contributions from the main facility. The planet attracted scholars seeking access to information that might not be available elsewhere in the Outer Rim, establishing Fusai's reputation as a center of learning despite its remote location.\n\nHowever, at some point in its history, Obroa-skai abandoned the Fusai branch facility, severing the connection between the two archives. The reasons for this decision remain unclear, though it may have been related to the costs of maintaining such a distant outpost or shifts in Obroa-skai's priorities. Following the abandonment, local scholars and administrators on Fusai took responsibility for maintaining the library, preserving its collections and continuing its mission of knowledge preservation.\n\nThe library on Fusai contained a sophisticated supercomputer system, a relic of its days as an official Celebratus Archive branch. This advanced computational infrastructure provided powerful data processing and analysis capabilities, making the facility valuable not just as a repository of information but as a tool for complex research and strategic planning.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Fusai remained nominally under Republic control, though its remote location meant it saw little direct involvement in the conflict. The planet's scholars continued their work, largely unaffected by the surrounding galactic turmoil.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Fusai fell under nominal Imperial authority. However, the Empire showed limited interest in the remote scholarly world, maintaining only minimal oversight. This relative neglect allowed Fusai to maintain considerable autonomy in managing its affairs.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Fusai's isolation and the Empire's lack of significant presence made it attractive to the Rebel Alliance. The planet became a safe world for Rebel operations, providing a secure location away from Imperial scrutiny where Alliance personnel could operate with minimal risk of discovery.\n\nThe library's supercomputer proved invaluable to the Rebel cause. Alliance strategists and tacticians used the system's analytical capabilities to process intelligence, model battle scenarios, and develop strategic plans for operations throughout the Outer Rim. The combination of the library's extensive historical records and the supercomputer's processing power allowed Rebel commanders to study past conflicts and apply those lessons to their struggle against the Empire.\n\nRebel cells used Fusai as a meeting point and planning center, taking advantage of the planet's scholarly reputation as cover for their activities. Alliance personnel could pose as researchers or students, blending in with the legitimate academic community while conducting their resistance work.\n\nThe local population, sympathetic to the Rebel cause, provided additional security by maintaining the appearance of normalcy and alerting Alliance personnel to any unusual Imperial interest in the planet. This cooperative relationship between the Rebels and Fusai's inhabitants allowed the Alliance to maintain operations there throughout much of the Galactic Civil War.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Fusai's status as a safe world for the Alliance became less critical as Imperial authority collapsed with no faction immediately claiming the planet.\n\nThe scholarly community on Fusai worked to rebuild connections with other academic institutions across the galaxy, including potentially reestablishing ties with Obroa-skai. The planet maintained its character as a center of learning in the Outer Rim, its library preserving knowledge accumulated over millennia while the supercomputer continued to serve researchers seeking to unlock the secrets of the past and plan for the future."

Garos IV maintained close ties to the Galactic Republic for thousands of years, though its remote location kept it largely isolated from major galactic events.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Garos IV remained loyal to the Republic, but its distance from major battlefronts spared it from direct conflict. The planet continued its traditional way of life, focusing on agriculture and local culture.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Garos IV came under Imperial control. The Empire established a garrison on the planet and imposed strict regulations, seeking to suppress dissent and maintain order. Imperial rule led to growing resentment among the Garosian population, with many citizens secretly opposing the Empire and supporting the Rebel Alliance.\n\nThe planet became a center for covert resistance activities, with Garosians providing intelligence and resources to the Rebellion while maintaining the appearance of compliance with Imperial authority. The Imperial presence remained strong throughout the Galactic Civil War, but local resistance persisted.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Garos IV's status remained contested as Mandalorian clans, Imperial remants, and corporate forces vied for influence in the region."

A frozen, inhospitable world perpetually covered in thick layers of ice and snow, Gerrenthum's surface features temperatures far below freezing across most of the planet, with violent blizzards and treacherous ice formations dominating the landscape.\n\nThe planet remained largely unexplored and unsettled for much of galactic history due to its extreme environment and remote location. The harsh conditions made long-term habitation extraordinarily difficult, with only the most determined colonists or desperate fugitives willing to endure Gerrenthum's frozen wastes.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Gerrenthum was occasionally noted on star charts as a waypoint along the Corellian Trade Spine, though few vessels made the journey to its frozen surface. The planet's lack of strategic resources and punishing environment meant it attracted minimal attention from governments or corporations.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Gerrenthum's isolation kept it far from the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. The planet remained effectively uninhabited, its ice fields undisturbed by the galactic struggle.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Gerrenthum fell under nominal Imperial authority as part of the Anoat sector. However, the Empire showed little interest in the frozen world, maintaining no permanent presence on its surface. The planet's location along the Corellian Trade Spine gave it some minor strategic relevance as a potential emergency stopover point, though most spacers preferred to avoid it entirely.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Gerrenthum's extreme isolation made it an occasional refuge for smugglers, pirates, and others seeking to avoid Imperial detection. The planet's harsh environment provided natural concealment, with sensor readings often disrupted by ice storms and atmospheric interference. However, few chose to remain on Gerrenthum for extended periods, as survival on the frozen surface required constant struggle against the elements.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Gerrenthum remained part of the Greater Javin region, which fell under the Iron Blockade established by Imperial forces unwilling to accept reports of the Emperor's death. During this period of isolation, the planet continued its existence as a frozen, largely forgotten world on the edge of known space.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Iron Blockade, Gerrenthum's status remained uncertain as various Imperial remnant factions, pirate clans, and the New Republic competed for control of the Anoat sector. The planet's combination of strategic position along the Corellian Trade Spine and its utterly inhospitable environment ensured it remained a world of minimal settlement but occasional tactical significance."

Geonosis is the homeworld of the insectoid Geonosian species, who live in a caste-based society led by hive queens and aristocrats, with workers and warriors forming the bulk of the population.\n\nGeonosis remained largely isolated for much of galactic history due to its inhospitable environment and remote location. The Geonosians developed advanced technology, specializing in droid manufacturing and engineering. Their underground foundries produced battle droids and starships for various clients, making Geonosis a major industrial center in the Outer Rim.\n\nThe planet's society revolved around hive structures, with gladiatorial combat serving as both entertainment and a means of enforcing social order. The Petranaki Arena in the capital was infamous for its brutal contests, where prisoners and criminals faced deadly beasts for the amusement of Geonosian spectators.\n\nShortly before the Clone Wars, Geonosis became a focal point of galactic events. Count Dooku and the Separatist movement established secret alliances with the planet's leadership, including Archduke Poggle the Lesser. The Geonosians provided the Separatists with battle droids and weapons, and the first Death Star plans were secretly developed on Geonosis.\n\nIn 22 BBY, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the Separatist presence on Geonosis while investigating an assassination attempt. Kenobi was captured and, along with Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, sentenced to death in the Petranaki Arena. Their execution was interrupted by a Jedi strike team led by Mace Windu, sparking the Battle of Geonosis, the opening conflict of the Clone Wars.\n\nRepublic clone troopers, led by Jedi Generals, fought Separatist droid armies across the planet's surface and in its orbital space. The battle resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, with Count Dooku escaping and the Republic claiming victory. The Republic established a garrison on Geonosis to prevent further Separatist activity, but the Geonosians continued to resist through guerrilla tactics and underground operations.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Geonosis remained a major battleground. The planet's droid foundries were repeatedly targeted by Republic forces, including a second major assault led by Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ki-Adi-Mundi. During this campaign, Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Padawan Barriss Offee destroyed key droid factories, and the Republic uncovered evidence of advanced weapons development.\n\nGeonosis was also the site of the creation of the Death Star's superweapon plans, which were handed to Count Dooku by Poggle the Lesser. The plans were later delivered to Darth Sidious, setting the stage for the Empire's ultimate weapon.\n\nAfter the Clone Wars, Geonosis fell under Imperial control. The Empire used the planet's foundries for secret construction projects, including the initial assembly of the Death Star. To conceal these activities, the Empire sterilized Geonosis, releasing biological weapons that wiped out nearly the entire Geonosian population. Only a handful of survivors remained, including a lone queen who attempted to preserve her species.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the Rebel Alliance discovered evidence of the genocide and the Death Star's origins on Geonosis. The planet remained a barren wasteland, its hive cities abandoned and its foundries silent.\n\In the years following the Battle of Endor, Geonosis's native population was still small, with only a few Geonosians surviving in hidden underground chambers. Corporations like Hoersch-Kessel Drive, Inc. took advantage of the power vacuum to convert the planet's facilities for their own use.

The planet's surface is almost entirely covered by water, with only three small continents and a modest archipelago breaking the endless waves. The vast oceans dominate the landscape, creating a world where aquatic life thrives in countless forms.\n\nGlee Anselm is home to two native sentient species. The Nautolans, amphibious humanoids with distinctive head-tails and large black eyes, are equally comfortable in water and on land. Their society developed a culture that emphasized family bonds and communal cooperation, with the oceans serving as the center of their civilization. The Anselmi, a reptilian species, inhabit the coastal regions and islands, having evolved as primarily terrestrial beings who maintain an uneasy relationship with their amphibious neighbors.\n\nThe planet experiences dramatic seasonal changes throughout its long orbital period, bringing powerful storms and cyclones that sweep across the oceans and landmasses. These seasonal shifts shaped both species' cultures, with Nautolan communities building underwater cities that could withstand the storms, while the Anselmi constructed their settlements in sheltered coastal areas.\n\nTensions between the Nautolans and Anselmi have existed for millennia, with territorial disputes and cultural differences occasionally erupting into conflict. However, both species eventually joined the Galactic Republic thousands of years before the rise of the Empire, learning to coexist under Republic oversight.\n\nOne of the most famous Nautolans in galactic history was Kit Fisto, a Jedi Master who served on the Jedi High Council during the final years of the Republic. Master Fisto was renowned for his combat prowess, his infectious smile, and his exceptional skill at underwater fighting. His presence on the Council demonstrated the respect Nautolans commanded throughout the galaxy.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Glee Anselm remained firmly loyal to the Galactic Republic. The planet contributed to the war effort, with Nautolan warriors serving in the Grand Army of the Republic and Kit Fisto leading Republic forces in numerous battles. The planet's strategic position along the Llanic Spice Route made it valuable for Republic military logistics.\n\nKit Fisto served with distinction throughout the Clone Wars, participating in major battles including the Battle of Geonosis and leading aquatic assault operations where his natural abilities gave Republic forces a significant advantage.

Hapan architecture is renowned throughout the galaxy for its elegant design, with soaring towers and graceful structures that reflect the species' aesthetic sensibilities.\n\nThe Hapan species are near-humans known for their exceptional physical beauty, a trait carefully cultivated over millennia of selective breeding within the isolated Hapes Cluster. Hapan society is strictly matriarchal, with women holding all positions of political power and most property rights. This social structure developed from the Consortium's unique history.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Hapes Cluster was controlled by pirates known as the Lorell Raiders, who preyed on passing ships throughout the region. These raiders would capture beautiful women from the vessels they attacked, bringing them back to the cluster. When the Jedi Order finally defeated the Lorell Raiders, the captured women and their descendants took control, establishing the matriarchal society that would define Hapan culture.\n\nThe Transitory Mists, a dense nebula surrounding the Hapes Cluster, provided natural protection and enforced isolation from the rest of the galaxy. This barrier made navigation into and out of the cluster extremely difficult, with only a few safe routes known to Hapan pilots. The isolation allowed the Hapes Consortium to develop independently, creating a unique culture and advanced technology separate from the galactic mainstream.\n\nHapan Battle Dragons and Nova-class battle cruisers became some of the most formidable warships in the known galaxy, featuring innovative designs and powerful weapons systems. The Consortium maintained a substantial military force, the Hapan Royal Navy, primarily for defensive purposes given their isolationist policies.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, the Hapes Consortium maintained minimal contact with the Galactic Republic, preferring to focus on internal affairs within the cluster. The matriarchal government, led by successive Queen Mothers, established a complex political system involving the Royal Court and representatives from the Consortium's sixty-three inhabited worlds.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, the Hapes Consortium maintained strict neutrality, refusing to commit forces to either the Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Transitory Mists continued to serve as an effective barrier, keeping the conflict at a distance from Hapan territory.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Hapes Consortium continued its isolationist policies. The Empire showed little interest in penetrating the Transitory Mists to conquer the cluster, and the Consortium had no desire to become entangled in Imperial politics. Queen Mother Ta'a Chume ruled during much of this period, maintaining the Consortium's independence through careful diplomacy and the implicit threat of the powerful Hapan Royal Navy.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the Hapes Consortium remained officially neutral, though some limited trade occurred with both Imperial and independent systems. The Consortium's weapons and technology occasionally found their way to black markets, though the government maintained tight control over exports of military hardware.\n\nQueen Mother Ta'a Chume gave birth to a son, Isolder, who became Prince of Hapes and heir to the throne. As the sole male heir in the matriarchal society, Isolder's future marriage became a matter of significant political importance, with various noble houses within the Consortium vying to have their daughters chosen as his bride.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, the Hapes Consortium began cautiously opening diplomatic relations with the outside galaxy. Prince Isolder, seeking to end the Consortium's isolation, proposed marriage to Princess Leia Organa as a means of forging an alliance between the Consortium and the New Republic. Though Leia ultimately married Han Solo instead, the diplomatic overture marked the beginning of the Consortium's emergence from millennia of isolation."

907302,New, "Hosnian Prime is a temperate planet in the Hosnian system of the Core Worlds, located along the Corellian Trade Spine hyperlane. A world of vast oceans dotted with numerous island chains and archipelagos, Hosnian Prime developed into a major commercial and political center due to its strategic location on one of the galaxy's most important trade routes.\n\nThe planet's surface features sprawling cities built across its island landmasses, connected by advanced infrastructure including orbital space stations and atmospheric traffic lanes. Its capital city serves as a hub for interstellar commerce and diplomacy.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Hosnian Prime was an influential member world, contributing significantly to galactic trade and governance. The planet maintained its importance through the Clone Wars, remaining loyal to the Republic despite the surrounding conflicts.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Hosnian Prime continued to serve as an important commercial world, though it fell under Imperial oversight like much of the Core. The planet's strategic value ensured a continued Imperial presence throughout the Galactic Civil War.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Empire's decline, Hosnian Prime became a prominent member of the New Republic. The planet's combination of economic prosperity and political stability made it an attractive location for the New Republic's rotating capital system."

907402,Old, "Hoth is the sixth planet of the remote Hoth system. A desolate world covered with ice and snow, located in the Anoat sector, a rarely-travelled portion of the Outer Rim Territories, it became famous as the one-time location of the Alliance to Restore the Republic's Echo Base during the Galactic Civil War."
907402,New, "Hoth is a remote ice planet located in the Anoat sector of the Outer Rim Territories. The sixth planet in the Hoth system, it orbits a blue-white star and features a harsh, frozen environment with extreme cold temperatures, violent blizzards, and a landscape dominated by ice plains, glaciers, and snow-covered mountain ranges.\n\nThe planet remained largely unexplored for much of galactic history due to its remote location and inhospitable conditions. Hoth's surface is perpetually covered in snow and ice, with temperatures well below freezing even during the daytime. The planet's ecosystem, though limited, includes several native species adapted to the extreme cold, most notably the massive wampa ice creatures that hunt across the frozen wastes and the tauntaun, herbivorous reptomammals used by the Rebel Alliance as mounts.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Hoth gained galactic significance when the Rebel Alliance established Echo Base within the planet's frozen caverns following their evacuation from Yavin 4. The Alliance chose Hoth specifically because its remote location and harsh environment made it an unlikely target for Imperial searches. Echo Base was constructed within a system of ice caves on the planet's northern hemisphere, with the Rebels installing a powerful shield generator to protect against orbital bombardment.\n\nFor a time, the secret base served as the Alliance's primary headquarters, housing military command, starfighter squadrons, and support personnel. However, Imperial probe droids eventually discovered the base's location, leading to one of the most significant battles of the Galactic Civil War.\n\nThe Battle of Hoth saw the Empire deploy overwhelming force against Echo Base, including a ground assault led by AT-AT walkers that breached the defensive perimeter. Despite determined resistance from Alliance forces, including the successful use of snowspeeders to destroy several AT-ATs, the Rebels were forced to evacuate the planet. While the Alliance suffered significant losses in equipment and supplies, the evacuation protocols allowed most personnel to escape, with transports fleeing the system as soon as the shield generator was disabled.\n\nFollowing the battle, Hoth returned to its former obscurity. The ruins of Echo Base remained in the ice, a frozen monument to one of the Rebellion's most desperate hours. The planet occasionally attracted scavengers seeking salvage from the battlefield, though the hostile environment and remaining dangers made such expeditions risky.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Hoth remained an uninhabited world, its harsh climate preventing colonization. The planet serves as a reminder of the Alliance's struggle against the Empire and their ability to endure even in the most hostile environments."

The homeworld of the insectoid Yam'rii species, Huk is covered by dense forests and features a humid climate well-suited to its native inhabitants.\n\nThe Yam'rii, also known as the Huk, a Kaleesh slur meaning ""soulless bug"", developed a technologically advanced and expansionist civilization. Thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Yam'rii began colonizing nearby worlds, including the planet Kalee, home of the reptilian Kaleesh species.\n\nThe Yam'rii's aggressive expansion led to the outbreak of the Huk War, a brutal conflict between the Yam'rii and the Kaleesh. The Yam'rii sought to enslave the Kaleesh and exploit Kalee's resources, while the Kaleesh, led by the legendary warrior Qymaen jai Sheelal, fought fiercely to defend their homeworld. The war saw the Kaleesh drive the Yam'rii from Kalee and launch retaliatory raids against Huk and other Yam'rii colonies.\n\nThe Yam'rii appealed to the Galactic Republic for intervention, portraying themselves as victims of Kaleesh aggression. The Republic, swayed by Yam'rii diplomacy, intervened on behalf of the Yam'rii and imposed harsh sanctions on Kalee, crippling the Kaleesh economy and leaving lasting resentment.\n\nThe aftermath of the Huk War had far-reaching consequences. Qymaen jai Sheelal, embittered by the Republic's actions, would later become the cyborg General Grievous, a key figure in the Clone Wars. The Yam'rii continued to inhabit Huk, maintaining their advanced society and recovering from the devastation of the conflict.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Huk remained aligned with the Republic, and the planet's strategic location in the Outer Rim ensured continued relevance in galactic affairs.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Huk fell under Imperial control along with much of the region, though the Yam'rii retained their distinct cultural identity and technological prowess."

907602,Old, "Hypori is a planet located in the Hypori system of the Ferra sector in the Outer Rim Territories. It is home to no sentient species, though it is host to windrails and massiffs. Its surface is covered in rocky landscapes and small oceans."
907602,New, "Hypori is a barren, rocky planet located in the Hypori system of the Ferra sector in the Outer Rim Territories. A desolate world characterized by harsh terrain, jagged rock formations, and limited vegetation, Hypori remained largely uninhabited by sentient species throughout most of galactic history.\n\nThe planet's surface features vast expanses of rocky badlands, scattered with boulders and broken terrain that makes navigation difficult. Small oceans dot the landscape, though these bodies of water support only limited ecosystems. The native fauna includes massiffs, large quadrupedal predators, and windrails, avian creatures adapted to the planet's harsh environment.\n\nFor thousands of years, Hypori attracted little attention from the broader galactic community due to its inhospitable conditions and lack of valuable resources. The planet remained largely unexplored, with only occasional survey missions documenting its barren surface.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Hypori's isolation ended when the Confederacy of Independent Systems established a significant military presence on the planet. The Separatists recognized that Hypori's remote location and harsh terrain made it an ideal location for secret military operations and droid manufacturing facilities.\n\nThe Techno Union, one of the Confederacy's most important member organizations, constructed extensive droid factories on Hypori's surface. These facilities produced battle droids for the Separatist war effort, taking advantage of the planet's isolation to operate away from Republic surveillance. The harsh environment proved no obstacle to droid manufacturing, as the automated workers required no life support or comfortable conditions.\n\nApproximately two years into the Clone Wars, the Battle of Hypori became one of the conflict's most significant engagements. A Republic task force, including several Jedi Generals, was ambushed by Separatist forces led by General Grievous. The cyborg commander personally engaged the Jedi in combat, demonstrating the devastating martial prowess that would make him one of the Republic's most feared enemies.\n\nDuring the battle, Grievous killed several Jedi, including Ki-Adi-Mundi's former Padawan, Shaak Ti, and seriously wounded others. The surviving Jedi, including Ki-Adi-Mundi, Aayla Secura, and Shaak Ti, were forced to take shelter in a damaged assault ship while clone troopers attempted to hold off the advancing droid army. The arrival of Republic reinforcements led by ARC trooper Captain Fordo eventually allowed the survivors to escape, though the Battle of Hypori demonstrated the Republic's vulnerability and Grievous's deadly capabilities.\n\nFollowing this engagement, Hypori remained under Separatist control for much of the Clone Wars. The Techno Union continued to operate its droid factories on the planet, producing battle droids and other military equipment for the Confederacy. Republic forces launched several attempts to capture or destroy these facilities, though the planet's hostile terrain and strong Separatist defenses made such operations extremely costly.\n\nNear the end of the Clone Wars, Republic forces finally succeeded in capturing Hypori, dealing a significant blow to the Separatist war effort. The planet's droid factories were shut down or destroyed, eliminating an important source of Separatist military production.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the end of the Clone Wars, Hypori came under Imperial control. The Empire maintained a minimal presence on the planet, primarily to ensure the former Separatist facilities remained decommissioned. The harsh environment and lack of economic value meant that Imperial oversight remained limited, with the planet returning to its former obscurity.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Hypori remained under nominal Imperial control, though the planet saw little military activity. Its remote location and barren surface made it strategically insignificant compared to other worlds in the Outer Rim.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Hypori's long quiet Separatist facilities sprung to life has the new homeworld of the Independent Commerce Guild."

907702,Old, "Ilum is an ice planet in the Unknown Regions, one of the main sources of the valuable Adegan crystals used in the construction of Jedi lightsabers. The caverns containing the crystals were long ago turned into a Jedi temple. Unlike the crystals of other planets, the crystals of Ilum are limited to blue, green and purple in colour. The planet is over ninety percent-covered by ice."
907702,New, "Ilum is a remote ice planet located deep within the Unknown Regions of the galaxy. The world's surface is almost entirely covered by glaciers and ice fields, with perpetual snowstorms sweeping across the frozen landscape. Despite its harsh environment, Ilum holds tremendous significance to the Jedi Order as one of the primary sources of kyber crystals used in lightsaber construction.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Jedi discovered Ilum and recognized the unique properties of its kyber crystals. These naturally occurring crystals, found deep within ice caverns beneath the planet's surface, resonated with the Force in ways that made them ideal for focusing a lightsaber's blade. The Jedi established a sacred temple on Ilum, building it into the planet's icy mountains to serve as both a place of meditation and a waypoint for Padawans undertaking the ancient ritual of constructing their first lightsabers.\n\nThe Crystal Caves of Ilum became one of the Jedi Order's most sacred sites. Young Jedi were brought to Ilum as part of their training, where they would venture into the caves in a ritual known as ""The Gathering."" Each Padawan would meditate and allow the Force to guide them to the kyber crystal that called to them. This deeply personal connection between Jedi and crystal was considered a crucial step in a Padawan's journey toward becoming a Jedi Knight.\n\nThe kyber crystals of Ilum naturally produced blue, green, yellow, and occasionally purple lightsaber blades. Each crystal's unique properties would harmonize with its wielder, creating a bond that lasted throughout the Jedi's life. The Jedi Temple on Ilum maintained this tradition for millennia, with generations of Jedi making the pilgrimage to the frozen world.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Ilum remained a closely guarded secret of the Jedi Order. The temple continued to serve its sacred purpose, with Padawans still traveling there to find their crystals despite the surrounding galactic conflict. The planet's location in the Unknown Regions and the Jedi's careful protection kept it hidden from the Separatists.\n\nFollowing the execution of Order 66 and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Ilum's fate changed dramatically. The Empire discovered the planet's location and recognized the strategic value of its kyber crystals. While the Jedi had used these crystals for lightsabers, the Empire saw them as vital components for their superweapon projects, particularly the Death Star's superlaser.\n\nImperial forces invaded Ilum, desecrating the ancient Jedi Temple and converting the planet into a massive mining operation. The Empire stripped away vast portions of the planet's icy surface, extracting kyber crystals on an industrial scale. Massive excavation equipment carved deep into Ilum's core, transforming the sacred world into a source of raw materials for Imperial weapons.\n\nThe Empire's exploitation of Ilum continued throughout the Galactic Civil War. The planet's kyber crystals were shipped to various Imperial facilities, including the construction sites of both Death Stars. The once-pristine ice world became scarred by mining operations, its natural beauty destroyed in service of Imperial military ambitions.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Imperial remnant forces maintained control of Ilum, recognizing its continued strategic value. The mining operations continued, though on a reduced scale as the fractured Empire struggled to maintain its grip on remote territories in the Unknown Regions."

A world of vast oceans dotted with scattered island chains, Imynusoph remained largely isolated from galactic affairs throughout much of its history.\n\nThe planet's surface features a single major landmass alongside numerous smaller archipelagos, with most settlements concentrated along coastal regions. The native Imynusophi species developed a maritime culture, becoming skilled seafarers and traders despite their world's distance from major population centers.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Imynusoph served primarily as a waypoint for vessels traveling the furthest reaches of the Hydian Way. Its strategic position at the terminus of this major trade route gave it some economic importance, though the planet never developed into a major commercial hub.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Imynusoph maintained neutrality, with its remote location sparing it from major conflicts. The planet's isolation proved both a blessing and a curse, as it avoided the devastation of war but also struggled to maintain contact with the galactic community.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Imynusoph fell under nominal Imperial control, though the Empire maintained only a minimal presence due to the planet's peripheral location and limited strategic value. Local governance largely remained in the hands of planetary authorities, with Imperial oversight limited to ensuring compliance with basic Imperial regulations.\n\nThe planet's economy relied primarily on fishing, aquaculture, and limited trade with passing vessels. Imynusoph never developed significant industrial infrastructure, maintaining its character as a quiet, isolated world on the edge of known space."

Its economy relies heavily on manufacturing and trade, with goods flowing along the Corellian Trade Spine to markets throughout the Outer Rim and beyond.\n\nIsde Naha maintains a strict stance against smuggling and illicit trade, with planetary authorities enforcing rigorous customs inspections and trade regulations. This reputation for law and order has made the planet a preferred destination for legitimate commerce, though it has also made it unpopular with smugglers and independent traders who prefer less scrutinized routes.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Isde Naha fell under Imperial control. The Empire maintained a garrison on the planet to protect its industrial facilities and ensure the continued flow of manufactured goods to Imperial markets.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Endor and the fragmentation of Imperial authority, the planet's status remained uncertain as various Imperial remnant factions, pirate clans, and the New Republic vied for control of strategic Outer Rim worlds."

908002,New, "Ithor is a lush terrestrial planet located in the Ottega system of the Mid Rim Territories, positioned along the Lesser Lantillian Route hyperlane. Often called the ""Mother Jungle"" by its inhabitants, Ithor is one of the most verdant and ecologically diverse worlds in the known galaxy, with its surface covered entirely by dense tropical rainforests, sprawling jungles, and vast plains of vegetation.\n\nThe planet is home to the Ithorian species, peaceful herbivorous beings known for their distinctive hammer-shaped heads, long curved necks, and two mouths positioned on opposite sides of their necks. The Ithorians, sometimes called ""Hammerheads"" by other species, developed one of the galaxy's most environmentally conscious civilizations, building their entire society around the principle of preserving and nurturing their planet's ecosystem.\n\nRather than constructing cities on Ithor's surface, the Ithorians built massive floating herdships - kilometer-long repulsorlift vessels that drift through the atmosphere above the jungle canopy. These elegant spacecraft serve as mobile cities, agricultural centers, and trade vessels, allowing Ithorian civilization to thrive without disturbing the pristine wilderness below. Each herdship is a self-contained ecosystem, featuring gardens, farms, and spaces for thousands of Ithorians to live and work.\n\nIthorian culture holds the surface of their homeworld as sacred ground. The ""Law of Life"" strictly governs interaction with the planet below, with each Ithorian permitted to visit the surface only three times in their lifetime - once as a youth, once as an adult, and once as an elder. This tradition ensures the jungle remains largely untouched by sapient interference, preserving its natural state for future generations.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Ithor joined the Galactic Republic and became renowned throughout the galaxy for the Ithorians' ecological expertise and peaceful nature. Ithorian herdships traveled widely, trading agricultural products and ecological services while sharing their philosophy of environmental stewardship with other worlds.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, the Ithorians earned respect as some of the galaxy's premier ecologists and agricultural scientists. Their herdships became mobile universities where other species could learn sustainable farming techniques and environmental management. The Ithorians' patient, methodical approach to problem-solving made them valued mediators and advisors throughout the Mid Rim.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Ithor remained loyal to the Galactic Republic. The planet's strategic location and the Ithorians' reputation for honesty made it an important neutral meeting ground for diplomatic negotiations. Ithorian herdships continued their travels throughout the conflict, providing food and medical supplies to Republic forces and civilian populations affected by the war.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Ithor came under Imperial oversight. The Empire established a presence on several Ithorian herdships to monitor trade and collect taxes, though the Ithorians' peaceful nature and lack of military significance meant Imperial interference remained limited. The Ithorians continued their traditional way of life, maintaining their environmental laws despite occasional Imperial pressure to exploit Ithor's resources.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Ithor officially remained under Imperial control, though many Ithorians privately sympathized with the Rebel Alliance. The species' commitment to peace and life made them natural opponents of the Empire's destructive policies. Some Ithorian herdships covertly supported the Rebellion, providing supplies and safe harbor for Alliance operatives while maintaining the appearance of Imperial loyalty.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Ithor found itself on the frontline, desired by multiple factions.\n\nThe planet's pristine jungles remained protected by the Law of Life, standing as a testament to what the galaxy could achieve through careful stewardship and respect for the natural world. Ithor continued to serve as a symbol of hope that life, given proper care and protection, could flourish even in a galaxy marked by conflict and destruction."

Jabiim's economy has historically relied on mining, with rich deposits of minerals beneath its muddy surface. However, decades of strip mining have left much of the planet scarred and polluted, contributing to environmental degradation and hazardous weather conditions.\n\nDuring the final years of the Galactic Republic, Jabiim became a major battleground in the Clone Wars. The planet's leadership, feeling neglected by the Republic, sided with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Battle of Jabiim was one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war, with Republic clone troopers and Jedi fighting in brutal conditions against determined Separatist forces and local resistance. The conflict resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, and the Republic was ultimately forced to withdraw, leaving the planet under Separatist control.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Jabiim fell under Imperial occupation. The Empire continued to exploit the planet's mineral resources, intensifying strip mining operations and further damaging the environment. Imperial rule was harsh, with local resistance movements forming in response to oppression and resource exploitation. The planet's population endured years of hardship under Imperial control, with many Jabiimi joining or supporting rebel activities against the Empire.\n\nDuring the Imperial era, Jabiim became a waypoint for refugees and fugitives seeking passage out of Imperial territory. The planet's remote location and constant storms made it a useful hiding place for those evading Imperial authorities. Secret routes and safe houses were established by underground networks to help people escape, including Force-sensitives hunted by the Empire.\n\nJabiim's legacy as a world of constant rain, mud, and conflict has made it a symbol of endurance and struggle in the galaxy. Its history is marked by the resilience of its people and the lasting scars of war and exploitation."

908202,Old, "Jakku is a planet in the Western Reaches of the Inner Rim. Once a lush and forested world, a past calamity has rendered it a scorched, barren desert. Few sapients inhabit this largely ignored planet, save for those that do not wish to hide."
908202,New, "Jakku is a remote desert planet located in the Western Reaches of the Inner Rim Territories, positioned along the Rimma Trade Route. A harsh, unforgiving world covered almost entirely by vast expanses of sand dunes, rocky outcroppings, and the scorching heat of its sun, Jakku is one of the most inhospitable inhabited planets in known space.\n\nThe planet's surface is dominated by endless desert wastes, with scattered settlements of scavengers and moisture farmers eking out meager existences among the dunes. Jakku's ecosystem is remarkably barren, with only the hardiest creatures surviving in the extreme conditions. The native steelpeckers, heat-adapted insects, and various desert predators represent the sparse wildlife that has evolved to endure the planet's harsh environment.\n\nFor thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Jakku remained largely unknown and unexplored. Its remote location and lack of valuable resources meant few spacers ventured to the isolated world. However, archaeological evidence suggests Jakku once held significance in the ancient past, with mysterious ruins and artifacts scattered beneath its sands hinting at a civilization long forgotten.\n\nThousands of years before the Empire, Jakku was discovered to harbor fragments of dark side knowledge and ancient Sith artifacts buried in its deserts. The exact nature of these relics and the civilization that left them remains a mystery, though some scholars theorize the planet may have served as a repository or place of exile in ages past.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Jakku remained an insignificant backwater world, rarely appearing on standard navigation charts. The few settlers who established themselves on the planet were typically fugitives, religious hermits, or desperate colonists seeking isolation from galactic civilization. These hardy individuals built small communities around what few moisture sources existed, surviving through scavenging and subsistence farming.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Jakku's isolation kept it far from the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. The planet continued its existence in obscurity, with its inhabitants largely unaware of and unaffected by the galactic struggle.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Emperor Palpatine took a personal interest in Jakku. The Emperor discovered the planet harbored ancient dark side energies and established secret research facilities in the deep desert to study these phenomena. Imperial archaeologists and dark side adepts conducted excavations seeking ancient Sith knowledge, though much of this activity remained highly classified.\n\nPalpatine also established Jakku as part of his Contingency plan - a series of protocols designed to ensure that if he died, the Empire would not survive him. The planet was chosen as one of several locations where these contingency operations would be centered, though the full extent of the Emperor's plans for Jakku remained known only to his most trusted servants.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Jakku remained under nominal Imperial control, though the Empire maintained only a minimal garrison given the planet's lack of strategic importance. The secret Imperial facilities continued their work in isolation, hidden from both the wider Empire and the Rebel Alliance.\n\nApproximately one year after the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Jakku became the site of one of the most significant battles in galactic history. Imperial forces, following protocols from the Emperor's Contingency, gathered at Jakku for a final confrontation with the New Republic. The Battle of Jakku saw massive fleets clash in orbit while ground forces fought across the desert surface.\n\nThe battle raged for days, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Dozens of Star Destroyers, including Super Star Destroyers, were destroyed in orbit, their flaming wreckage crashing into Jakku's desert surface. The carnage was immense, with thousands of vessels and millions of personnel engaged in desperate combat.\n\nThe New Republic emerged victorious, though at great cost. The battle marked the decisive end of the Galactic Civil War, with the Empire's defeat at Jakku forcing the surviving Imperial leadership to sue for peace. The Galactic Concordance, signed shortly after, officially ended the conflict and severely restricted the remnants of the Empire.\n\nFollowing the battle, Jakku's desert became a massive graveyard of destroyed Imperial and New Republic vessels. The wrecks of Star Destroyers jutted from the sands like tombstones, creating the largest starship debris field in the known galaxy.\n\nIn the years after the battle, Jakku's population grew as scavengers arrived from across the galaxy, seeking to salvage valuable technology and components from the wrecked vessels. These scavengers established settlements like Niima Outpost, where salvaged goods could be traded for food, water, and supplies. The economy became entirely based on scavenging, with traders purchasing salvage and selling it to various interests throughout the galaxy.\n\nThe New Republic maintained a presence on Jakku immediately following the battle, working to secure dangerous materials and prevent the spread of Imperial weapons technology. However, as years passed and the New Republic focused on rebuilding galactic civilization, oversight of Jakku diminished. The planet returned to its status as a remote desert world, though now dotted with the ruins of one of history's greatest battles."

908302,New, "The Greater Javin is a remote region of space located in the Outer Rim Territories, positioned within the Western Reaches and encompassing three subsectors: the Javin subsector, the Anoat subsector, and the Yarith subsector. This isolated area has maintained a distinct identity throughout galactic history, characterized by its distance from major population centers and its unique economic and cultural development.\n\nThe Greater Javin region remained largely unexplored and unsettled for much of galactic history due to its remote location and the navigational challenges posed by the surrounding space. The region's isolation kept it off most major trade routes and navigation charts during the Old Republic era.\n\nApproximately five hundred years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the renowned entrepreneur and explorer Ecclessis Figg launched expeditions into the region. Figg's scouts charted new hyperspace routes extending the Corellian Trade Spine into and through the Greater Javin, opening the area to colonization and commercial exploitation. This exploration proved crucial to the region's subsequent development.\n\nFigg himself became one of the Greater Javin's most important figures, establishing Cloud City on Bespin and founding various other commercial ventures throughout the region. His efforts transformed the Greater Javin from an unexplored backwater into a viable, if still remote, area of settlement and economic activity.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, the Greater Javin developed slowly, attracting independent settlers, miners, and entrepreneurs seeking opportunities away from the heavily regulated Core Worlds. The region's isolation allowed for a degree of independence and self-governance unusual even for the Outer Rim.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, the Greater Javin maintained a position of relative neutrality, with most worlds in the region avoiding formal alignment with either the Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The area's remoteness spared it from major battles, though its resources and strategic position attracted occasional interest from both sides.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Greater Javin came under nominal Imperial control. However, the region's distance from Imperial Center meant that Imperial authority remained limited in practice. Local governments and criminal organizations, particularly elements of the Hutt Cartel, wielded considerable power throughout the region.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the Greater Javin remained under Imperial oversight, though many inhabitants privately sympathized with the Rebel Alliance. The region's industries, particularly tibanna gas production on Bespin, contributed to the Imperial economy.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Endor and the death of Emperor Palpatine, Imperial forces in the Greater Javin refused to accept reports of the Empire's defeat. Moff Adelhard, the regional Imperial governor, established what became known as the Iron Blockade, sealing off the entire Greater Javin region from the rest of the galaxy. This military cordon prevented news of the Emperor's death from reaching the sector's inhabitants and blocked all travel in or out of the region.\n\nThe Iron Blockade lasted for several months, during which time the Greater Javin existed in isolation, its population unaware of the dramatic changes occurring in the wider galaxy. Imperial forces within the blockade maintained order through increasingly authoritarian measures, while resistance movements began to form among the trapped populations.\n\nEventually, the Iron Blockade collapsed as Imperial authority fragmented and the truth about the Emperor's death could no longer be suppressed. The Greater Javin emerged from isolation to find the galaxy fundamentally changed, with the New Republic rising to challenge the remnants of the Empire.\n\nFollowing the blockade's end, the Greater Javin's status remained contested between various Imperial remnant factions, pirate clans, and the New Republic. The region's isolation and distinct character persisted even as it slowly integrated into the post-Imperial galactic order."

908402,Old, "Jedha, also known as the Pilgrim Moon, or as the Cold Moon, is a small desert moon which orbited the planet NaJedha. The historical and spiritual significance of Jedha led the moon to become a world of worship for those who believed in the Force, and a holy site for pilgrims who sought spiritual guidance.\nJedha City was once located on the surface of this moon, but it was destroyed by the Empire."
908402,New, "Jedha is a small desert moon located in the Mid Rim Territories, orbiting the planet NaJedha in the Jedha system. A cold, arid world with a thin atmosphere, Jedha's surface is dominated by vast deserts, rocky mesas, and ancient ruins that have stood for millennia.\n\nFor thousands of years, Jedha has been revered throughout the galaxy as one of the first civilizations to explore the nature of the Force. The moon became a spiritual center and place of pilgrimage for those who believed in the Force, regardless of their specific traditions or interpretations. Jedha's significance transcended any single organization, with the moon serving as holy ground for believers from countless cultures and eras.\n\nThe moon's surface is dotted with ancient temples, monasteries, and sacred sites built by various Force-worshipping cultures over millennia. The Temple of the Kyber, also known as the Temple of the Whills, stood as one of Jedha's most sacred locations. This massive structure, carved from stone and built around natural kyber crystal formations, served as a center of worship and study for the Guardians of the Whills and other Force devotees.\n\nJedha's greatest treasure was its vast deposits of kyber crystals, naturally occurring gems that resonated with the Force. These crystals formed in massive caverns beneath the moon's surface, creating a spiritual resonance that many believed made Jedha itself alive with the Force. For millennia, Jedi traveled to Jedha to obtain kyber crystals for their lightsabers, viewing the pilgrimage as an important spiritual journey.\n\nJedha City, built among ancient ruins in a deep canyon, served as the moon's primary settlement. The Holy City, as it was known, featured architecture spanning thousands of years, with newer structures built atop and around ancient temples and monuments. The city's narrow streets and crowded markets bustled with pilgrims, monks, and traders from across the galaxy.\n\nThe Guardians of the Whills, an ancient order devoted to protecting Jedha's spiritual sites and preserving knowledge of the Force, maintained temples and monasteries throughout the moon. Though not Jedi, the Guardians served as protectors of Jedha's holy places and guides for pilgrims seeking spiritual enlightenment.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Jedha maintained its traditional neutrality, welcoming pilgrims and Force-sensitives from all sides of the conflict. The moon's spiritual significance meant most factions respected its sacred status, though the war disrupted pilgrim traffic and brought hardship to the local population.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the Jedi Purge, Jedha's importance took on a darker dimension. The Empire recognized the moon's kyber crystal deposits as vital for their secret superweapon projects, particularly the Death Star. Imperial forces occupied Jedha, establishing a massive mining operation to extract kyber crystals on an industrial scale.\n\nThe occupation transformed Jedha into a police state. Stormtroopers patrolled the streets of the Holy City, and Imperial cargo shuttles constantly transported extracted kyber crystals off-world. The Empire's mining operations desecrated sacred sites and ancient temples, stripping away rock to reach crystal deposits beneath. Many of Jedha's spiritual traditions were suppressed, with the Empire viewing Force worship as a dangerous remnant of the Jedi Order.\n\nThe Guardians of the Whills and other spiritual groups were persecuted under Imperial rule. Some went into hiding, while others formed resistance cells to fight against the occupation. The once-peaceful moon became a center of insurgent activity, with various rebel groups conducting guerrilla operations against Imperial forces.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Jedha remained under Imperial occupation. The moon's strategic importance as a source of kyber crystals ensured continued Imperial presence despite persistent resistance. Saw Gerrera, an extremist rebel leader, established operations on Jedha, conducting increasingly violent attacks against Imperial forces.\n\nShortly before the Battle of Yavin, the Empire tested the Death Star's superlaser on Jedha. Director Orson Krennic ordered a low-power shot to demonstrate the station's capabilities and eliminate Saw Gerrera's rebels. The blast completely destroyed the Holy City and created a massive crater, killing millions including Saw Gerrera and his followers. The destruction was officially attributed to a mining disaster by Imperial propaganda.\n\nThe attack left Jedha devastated but not destroyed. However, the moon's orbit was destabilized by the blast, and debris from the destroyed city created a deadly ring around the moon. The surviving population was forced to evacuate as the moon's environment became increasingly uninhabitable.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Empire's defeat, Jedha remained a scarred and largely abandoned world, its once-thriving spiritual community scattered across the galaxy. The moon stood as a grim monument to Imperial brutality and the cost of the Death Star project that had consumed so many lives and resources."

908502,Old, "Kabal is a planet in the Outer Rim. Before the Clone Wars, Confederate interference led to massive food shortages on the world, in a plot to encourage Kabal to secede from the Republic. The operation was successful, and the planet joined the Separatists. During the Galactic Civil War, Kabal maintained neutrality against both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, even in spite of an Imperial assault on the Conference of Uncommitted Worlds being held there."
908502,New, "Kabal is a terrestrial planet located in the Kabal system of the Outer Rim Territories. A world of varied terrain including plains, forests, and urban centers, Kabal developed as a modest agricultural and manufacturing center, maintaining membership in the Galactic Republic for thousands of years.\n\nDuring the final years of the Galactic Republic, Kabal became a target of Separatist manipulation. The Confederacy of Independent Systems orchestrated a covert operation to destabilize the planet's economy and create conditions that would encourage Kabal to secede from the Republic. Through sabotage and interference with supply chains, the Separatists engineered massive food shortages across Kabal, causing widespread suffering among the population.\n\nAs the crisis deepened, many Kabalians blamed the Republic for failing to protect their interests or provide adequate relief. The Separatists capitalized on this discontent, offering aid and promising that independence from the Republic would bring prosperity. The operation proved successful - Kabal officially seceded from the Republic and joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Kabal remained under Separatist control, contributing resources to the Confederacy's war effort. The planet's strategic location in the Outer Rim made it valuable for Separatist logistics, serving as a waypoint for supply convoys moving through the region.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the end of the Clone Wars, Kabal came under Imperial authority. The transition proved difficult for many Kabalians, who had joined the Separatists seeking independence rather than embracing authoritarian rule. The Empire established a garrison on the planet to maintain order and ensure compliance with Imperial regulations.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Kabal adopted a position of strict neutrality, refusing to commit to either the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance. The planet's leadership sought to avoid the mistakes that had led them into the Clone Wars, maintaining independence from both sides of the conflict.\n\nKabal's neutral stance made it an attractive location for diplomatic gatherings between uncommitted worlds. At some point during the Galactic Civil War, the planet hosted the Conference of Uncommitted Worlds, a meeting of planetary representatives who had chosen to remain neutral in the conflict between the Empire and the Rebellion.\n\nThe conference drew Imperial attention, and Imperial forces launched an assault on Kabal in an attempt to disrupt the gathering and intimidate the neutral worlds into supporting the Empire. The attack demonstrated the Empire's willingness to use military force against worlds that refused to openly declare loyalty, even when those worlds maintained official neutrality.\n\nDespite the Imperial assault, Kabal maintained its neutral position throughout the remainder of the Galactic Civil War. The planet's leadership refused to be coerced into choosing sides, viewing both the Empire and the Rebellion as outside powers whose conflicts threatened Kabal's independence.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Kabal's status remained uncertain. The planet's history of manipulation by outside powers during the Clone Wars and its experience with Imperial aggression during the Galactic Civil War left its population wary of making commitments to any galactic government. The Kabalians worked to maintain their independence while carefully navigating the complex political landscape of the post-Imperial era."

908602,Old, "Kadavo is a planet in Wild Space. A barren world of dormant volcanoes and thick smog, Kadavo was part of the Zygerrian Slave Empire, and housed a slave processing facility. During the Clone Wars, a colony of Togruta was kidnapped by the Zygerrians and transported here, but a Republic force, led by General Anakin Skywalker, raided the facility and destroyed it, freeing the slaves."
908602,New, "Kadavo is a volcanic planet located in the Kadavo system within the Outer Rim Territories. A harsh, inhospitable world characterized by active volcanism, toxic atmosphere, and oppressive heat, Kadavo's surface is dominated by lava flows, ash fields, and jagged volcanic peaks that pierce through perpetual clouds of sulfurous gas.\n\nFor thousands of years, Kadavo served as a major hub of the Zygerrian Slave Empire, an ancient civilization built on the exploitation of conquered peoples. The Zygerrians established massive slave processing facilities on Kadavo, taking advantage of the planet's hostile environment as a natural deterrent to escape. The volcanic conditions and toxic atmosphere ensured that slaves transported to Kadavo had virtually no hope of fleeing into the wilderness.\n\nThe slave processing facility on Kadavo was an enormous complex suspended above active lava flows, accessible only by air. This fortress-like installation served as a holding center where newly captured slaves were broken, trained, and prepared for sale throughout Zygerrian space. The facility's design was deliberately cruel, with cages suspended over molten lava and minimal life support, ensuring complete control over the captive population through fear and the constant threat of death.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Jedi Order helped the Galactic Republic destroy the Zygerrian Slave Empire, liberating countless beings held in bondage across their territories. Following this defeat, Kadavo's slave facilities were abandoned and the planet fell into obscurity, though the Zygerrians never forgot their former glory.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, approximately 21 years before the rise of the Empire, the Zygerrian Slave Empire attempted to rebuild its former power by allying with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Zygerrians, led by Queen Miraj Scintel, began conducting slaving operations throughout the Outer Rim, capturing Republic citizens and selling them into servitude.\n\nThe Zygerrians reactivated the slave processing facility on Kadavo, bringing it back into operation under the command of Keeper Agruss, a sadistic Zygerrian administrator who took pleasure in tormenting the slaves under his control. The facility resumed its original function as a center for breaking and processing captives.\n\nWhen a colony of 50,000 Togruta from the neutral world of Kiros disappeared, the Jedi Council dispatched Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano to investigate. The Jedi discovered that the Zygerrians had kidnapped the entire population and were transporting them to the slave markets.\n\nThe rescue attempt went awry when the Jedi were captured by Queen Scintel. While Skywalker was held captive on the Zygerrian homeworld, Kenobi and Captain Rex were transported to Kadavo as slaves, forced to witness the suffering of the Togruta colonists held in the facility's horrific conditions.\n\nKeeper Agruss used Kenobi's presence to demonstrate Zygerrian power, torturing both the Jedi Master and the Togruta captives while boasting of the Zygerrians' return to prominence. The facility's defenses included numerous guards, electrified cages, and the constant threat of dropping prisoners into the lava below.\n\nSkywalker, having escaped from Zygerria following Queen Scintel's death at the hands of Count Dooku, led a Republic assault on Kadavo to rescue the captives. Republic forces, including clone troopers and Jedi, attacked the facility despite being outnumbered by Zygerrian guards and facing the installation's formidable defenses.\n\nDuring the battle, Keeper Agruss attempted to execute the slaves by dropping their cages into the lava, but was killed by the Togruta colonist Governor Roshti before he could complete his revenge. The Republic forces succeeded in overwhelming the Zygerrian guards and destroying the facility's critical systems.\n\nWith the installation disabled and the guards defeated, Republic forces evacuated all 50,000 Togruta colonists along with other slaves held at the facility. The slaves were returned to their homeworlds, and the Kadavo slave processing center was left in ruins.\n\nFollowing the Republic's victory at Kadavo, the Zygerrian Slave Empire's resurgence was dealt a significant blow. The destruction of their primary processing facility and the loss of thousands of potential slaves severely damaged their operations and their credibility with their Separatist allies.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kadavo remained a largely abandoned world, its ruined slave facility standing as a grim monument to Zygerrian cruelty and the Republic's eventual triumph. The planet's hostile environment ensured few chose to return to the volcanic wasteland.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Kadavo continued its existence as a forgotten world in the Outer Rim, its dark history remembered primarily by those who had suffered there and those who had fought to end its nightmare."

908702,Old, "Kalee is a planet located in Wild Space. Home to the warlike Kaleesh, it is a harsh, tropical world, covered in the Kaleeshi's temple-like homes. Since the planet's introduction to the galactic community, Kalee has sent its people to serve as warriors, bodyguards, and mercenaries for many conflicts and parties. Decades before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Republic convinced the Kaleesh to wage war against an isolationist neighbour, then sided against them in their conflict with the insectoid Huks. A prominent Kaleesh general during the Huk War, Qymaen jai Sheelal, eventually became the dreaded Separatist cyborg Grievous."
908702,New, "Kalee is a harsh tropical world located in the Mytaranor sector of the Expansion Region, though its remote position places it effectively in Wild Space. The homeworld of the reptilian Kaleesh species, Kalee features dense jungles, arid badlands, and numerous predatory creatures that shaped the evolution of its fierce warrior inhabitants.\n\nThe Kaleesh developed a culture centered on honor, warfare, and spiritual beliefs. Their society reveres fallen warriors, with religious practices involving ancestor worship and the wearing of bone masks that grant spiritual protection. Kaleesh architecture features distinctive temple-like structures called Shrupak, built to honor their gods and ancestors.\n\nFor much of galactic history, Kalee remained isolated, with the Kaleesh developing independently until discovered by Republic explorers. The planet's harsh environment and the Kaleesh's fierce nature meant colonization attempts were minimal, with the species maintaining control over their homeworld.\n\nApproximately forty years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kalee faced invasion by the insectoid Yam'rii from the neighboring planet Huk. The Yam'rii, also known as the Huk, sought to colonize Kalee and enslave its population. The invasion sparked the devastating Huk War, which would define a generation of Kaleesh.\n\nThe Kaleesh warrior Qymaen jai Sheelal emerged as the species' greatest hero during this conflict. Leading Kaleesh forces with brilliant tactical skill and ferocious determination, he drove the Yam'rii from Kalee and pursued them back to their own worlds. The Kaleesh campaign became a war of vengeance, with warriors following Sheelal in raids against Yam'rii colonies.\n\nHowever, the Yam'rii appealed to the Galactic Republic for aid, portraying the Kaleesh as aggressors. The Republic, unaware of the full context of the conflict and swayed by Yam'rii diplomacy, intervened on behalf of the Huk. Republic forces blockaded Kalee and demanded the Kaleesh end their campaign.\n\nThe Republic's intervention devastated Kalee. Economic sanctions and the cost of the prolonged war left the planet impoverished. Many Kaleesh starved as resources dwindled. The species that had successfully defended their homeworld found themselves punished by the galactic government they had hoped would support them.\n\nQymaen jai Sheelal, the hero who had saved his people, was left bitter and disillusioned. The Republic's betrayal, as he saw it, fostered deep resentment toward galactic institutions. This bitterness would later be exploited by the InterGalactic Banking Clan, which offered to rebuild Kalee's economy in exchange for Kaleesh service as enforcers.\n\nSheelal himself was critically injured in a shuttle crash. The Banking Clan, seeing potential in the legendary warrior, transformed him into a cyborg and gave him a new identity: General Grievous. The transformation stripped away much of his Kaleesh identity while preserving his tactical genius and combat prowess.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, many Kaleesh served as mercenaries and warriors for various factions. Their reputation for ferocity and skill made them highly sought after, with Kaleesh warriors serving as elite troops and bodyguards throughout the galaxy. However, General Grievous's prominence as Supreme Commander of the Separatist Droid Army brought mixed feelings to his homeworld.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kalee fell under nominal Imperial control, though the Empire maintained only minimal presence on the remote world. The Kaleesh's warrior culture and isolation meant they continued their traditional way of life with little Imperial interference.\n\nMany Kaleesh left their homeworld to serve as mercenaries, bounty hunters, and warriors throughout the galaxy. Their distinctive bone masks, reptilian features, and fearsome combat abilities made them recognizable throughout the Outer Rim and beyond.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Kalee remained officially neutral, though individual Kaleesh served both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance as mercenaries. The planet's isolation from major conflict zones meant it avoided becoming a battleground in the larger struggle.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Kalee's status remained uncertain. The planet's poverty and isolation meant no major faction prioritized establishing control, leaving the Kaleesh to govern themselves while their warriors continued serving as mercenaries across the galaxy."

908802,Old, "Kamino is an aquatic world beyond the Outer Rim. Located between the primary galaxy and one of its satellite dwarf galaxies, the Rishi Maze, Kamino is home to the enigmatic Kaminoans, who had mastered genetic engineering and cloning technologies to save themselves from the ecological disaster that flooded their world. Known only to a few members of the Republic for thousands of years, Kamino suddenly became a critical asset leading up to and during the Clone Wars, in which the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic were created on the planet. After the conflict, the Galactic Empire forcibly relocated the Kaminoans and their technology, and destroyed every facility on the planet."
908802,New, "Kamino is a remote aquatic planet located in Wild Space, positioned south of the Rishi Maze satellite dwarf galaxy. The entire surface of Kamino is covered by a vast, stormy ocean, with no landmasses breaking the endless waves. The native Kaminoans constructed massive stilted cities rising above the turbulent seas, creating elegant spires that pierce through the planet's perpetual storm clouds.\n\nThe Kaminoans are a tall, graceful species known for their pale skin, elongated necks, and large, almond-shaped eyes adapted to their world's dim light. They are renowned throughout the galaxy as master cloners and genetic engineers, having developed these technologies over millennia to adapt their species to Kamino's changing environment.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kamino underwent dramatic climate change that caused the planet's ice caps to melt, flooding the surface and forcing the Kaminoans to adapt or perish. Rather than abandon their homeworld, they turned to genetic manipulation, modifying their own species to survive in the new aquatic environment while simultaneously perfecting cloning technologies that would eventually make them famous throughout the galaxy.\n\nThe Kaminoans established Tipoca City as their capital, a massive facility that served as both a population center and the heart of their cloning industry. The city's gleaming white structures became synonymous with Kaminoan technological achievement, housing sophisticated laboratories and cloning facilities capable of producing organisms with unprecedented precision.\n\nFor much of galactic history, Kamino remained isolated from the broader galactic community. The planet's location in Wild Space, combined with the Kaminoans' preference for privacy regarding their work, meant that few outsiders visited the world. However, the Kaminoans maintained contacts with select clients throughout the galaxy, offering their cloning services to those who could afford them and meet their exacting standards.\n\nApproximately ten years before the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, acting without the knowledge or approval of the Jedi Council, secretly commissioned the Kaminoans to create a clone army for the Galactic Republic. Using the bounty hunter Jango Fett as the genetic template, the Kaminoans began producing millions of clone troopers, trained from birth for military service.\n\nThe Sith Lord Darth Tyranus, publicly known as Count Dooku, became involved in the project after Sifo-Dyas's death, ensuring the clones would serve the Sith's ultimate plan to destroy the Jedi Order and establish the Galactic Empire. The Kaminoans, focused on the technical perfection of their work, remained largely unaware of the larger conspiracy they were facilitating.\n\nTen years after the initial order, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi arrived on Kamino while investigating the attempted assassination of Senator Padmé Amidala. The Kaminoans, believing the Jedi had come to inspect the clone army, welcomed him and revealed the massive military force they had created. This discovery led directly to the outbreak of the Clone Wars when the Grand Army of the Republic was deployed to rescue Jedi on Geonosis.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Kamino became one of the Republic's most strategically important worlds. The planet's cloning facilities worked continuously to produce replacement troops for the Grand Army, with new batches of clones constantly being grown, trained, and deployed to battlefronts across the galaxy. The Kaminoans took great pride in their work, viewing each clone as a testament to their genetic expertise.\n\nThe Confederacy of Independent Systems recognized Kamino's importance and launched a major assault on the planet during the war. The Battle of Kamino saw massive droid forces, including aquatic assault vehicles, attacking Tipoca City in an attempt to destroy the Republic's ability to produce more clone troopers. Republic forces, including clone troopers defending their homeworld, successfully repelled the attack, though the battle demonstrated Kamino's vulnerability.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the end of the Clone Wars, Kamino's role began to change. The Empire continued to use Kaminoan cloning facilities initially, but Emperor Palpatine grew concerned about relying on a single source for military personnel. The Empire began recruiting regular human soldiers and establishing training facilities on other worlds.\n\nThe Kaminoans' attempts to create a more independent clone force, free from the inhibitor chips that ensured loyalty to the Empire, led to increasing tensions with Imperial authorities. The Empire viewed any unauthorized cloning projects as potential threats to Imperial control.\n\nDuring the early years of the Galactic Civil War, Imperial presence on Kamino remained significant, though the planet's importance had diminished from its Clone Wars peak. Some cloning operations continued, though on a much reduced scale compared to wartime production.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Kamino's fate remained uncertain. The planet's cloning facilities, while still functional, had been greatly reduced from their wartime capacity. The Kaminoans continued their genetic research, though their role in galactic affairs had diminished significantly from the days when their clone armies had shaped the fate of the entire galaxy."

908902,New, "Kashyyyk is a lush, forested planet located in the Mytaranor sector of the Mid Rim Territories. The homeworld of the Wookiee species, Kashyyyk is entirely covered by massive wroshyr trees that tower kilometers into the sky, creating a unique multi-layered ecosystem. The planet's ecology is divided into distinct levels - from the dangerous Shadowlands at ground level where the most fearsome predators dwell, through the middle levels where most Wookiees live, to the uppermost canopy where the wroshyr trees reach toward the sky.\n\nThe Wookiees are a species of tall, fur-covered humanoids known throughout the galaxy for their great strength, mechanical aptitude, and unwavering loyalty. Their culture emphasizes honor, family bonds, and the sacred concept of life debts - a Wookiee who is saved by another being will devote their life to serving and protecting their savior. Despite their fearsome appearance and warrior traditions, Wookiees maintain a deep reverence for nature and live in harmony with their forest world, building their tree cities without harming the ancient wroshyr trees.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kashyyyk was discovered by the Galactic Republic and became a member world. The Wookiees proved to be valuable members of galactic civilization, with many leaving their homeworld to serve as mechanics, pilots, and warriors throughout the galaxy. Their technical skills and loyalty made them highly sought after, though they never forgot their connection to their forest home.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Kashyyyk remained steadfastly loyal to the Republic. Near the war's end, the Confederacy of Independent Systems launched a major invasion of the planet, recognizing its strategic importance and seeking to strike at the Republic's morale. The Battle of Kashyyyk saw intense fighting as Republic forces, including Jedi Master Yoda, worked alongside Wookiee warriors to defend the tree cities from droid armies.\n\nWhen Order 66 was executed during the battle, clone troopers turned on their Jedi commanders. Master Yoda narrowly escaped with the help of Wookiee leaders Tarfful and Chewbacca, who smuggled him off-world. This act of defiance would have severe consequences for the Wookiee people.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kashyyyk was brutally subjugated. The Empire enslaved the Wookiee population on a massive scale, viewing them as little more than valuable labor. Imperial forces occupied the planet, stripping its forests of resources while shipping Wookiees throughout the galaxy to work on Imperial projects. The construction of the Death Star relied heavily on Wookiee slave labor, with thousands forced to work in brutal conditions.\n\nThe occupation of Kashyyyk was maintained by Imperial garrison forces and enforced through intimidation and violence. Any Wookiee resistance was met with overwhelming force, including orbital bombardment threats against the tree cities. Many Wookiees were separated from their families and transported off-world, never to return.\n\nDespite this oppression, the Wookiees never ceased resisting their Imperial masters. Those who managed to escape slavery often joined the Rebel Alliance, bringing their technical skills and warrior prowess to the fight against the Empire. Chewbacca, the famous Wookiee companion of Han Solo, became one of the Rebellion's most recognizable heroes.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Kashyyyk remained under firm Imperial control, serving as both a source of slave labor and a symbol of Imperial dominance. The Empire maintained a strong presence on the planet throughout the conflict, though Wookiee resistance movements continued to operate in the deep forests.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Imperial control over Kashyyyk began to weaken. However, liberation proved difficult as various Imperial remnant factions continued to contest control of the planet. The New Republic launched multiple campaigns to free Kashyyyk, recognizing both the moral imperative of ending Wookiee enslavement and the planet's strategic value.\n\nThe liberation of Kashyyyk became a protracted struggle, with fighting continuing for years after Endor. Wookiee resistance fighters, supported by New Republic forces, gradually drove Imperial forces from the tree cities. However, complete liberation took time, as Imperial remnants refused to relinquish such a valuable source of labor and resources."

A temperate world with varied terrain including forests, plains, and mountain ranges, Kelada developed a modest population centered around agriculture and light manufacturing.\n\nThe planet maintained a quiet existence for much of galactic history, remaining largely isolated from major conflicts due to its remote location. Its inhabitants, primarily human colonists, established small farming communities and trading posts that served the needs of the local sector.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Kelada remained neutral, avoiding entanglement in the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. The planet's isolation allowed it to escape the devastation that befell many worlds during this period.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kelada fell under Imperial control. The Empire established a presence on the planet, primarily to maintain order and collect taxes, though the garrison remained relatively small given Kelada's limited strategic value. The Imperial occupation brought increased regulation and oversight to the planet's trade and commerce.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Kelada remained under Imperial control, serving as a minor supply depot and waypoint for Imperial forces operating in the Anarid Cluster. The planet's inhabitants largely accepted Imperial rule, though some sympathized with the Rebel Alliance cause.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the fragmentation of Imperial authority, Kelada's status became uncertain as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for influence in the Outer Rim."

The planet is infamous throughout the galaxy as the source of the highly valuable and addictive substance known as spice, as well as coaxium and Kesselstone.\n\nKessel's northern hemisphere is dominated by extensive mining operations, where prisoners and slaves labor in brutal conditions to extract spice from deep beneath the planet's surface. The spice mines of Kessel have become synonymous with the worst form of penal servitude, with many criminals throughout the galaxy sentenced to hard labor in these deadly tunnels.\n\nThe planet's southern hemisphere contrasts sharply with the industrial north, featuring lush gardens and sanctuaries maintained by the planet's administrators. These areas serve as retreats for those wealthy and powerful enough to afford such luxury, while the vast majority of Kessel's population toils in the mines.\n\nKessel has changed hands numerous times throughout its history. During the Old Republic era, the planet was controlled by various criminal organizations and corporate interests seeking to profit from its valuable resources. The Tion Hegemony once claimed Kessel before it fell into the hands of independent operators.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Kessel remained largely outside the main conflict, though both the Republic and Separatists sought to control its spice production. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire, Imperial forces took control of Kessel, using the planet as a prison world and continuing the brutal exploitation of its resources.\n\nThe Kessel Run, a hyperspace route used by smugglers to transport spice from Kessel while avoiding Imperial patrols, became one of the most famous - and dangerous - routes in the galaxy. Pilots who could complete the Run quickly earned considerable reputation among the smuggling community.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, control of Kessel remained contested between corporations and criminal organizations, with various factions vying for control of the planet's valuable spice production."

Despite its inhospitable nature, Korriban holds a central place in Sith history and lore.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Korriban was the throneworld of the Sith Empire. After the Great Hyperspace War, the planet was abandoned and became a barren necropolis, its great tombs sealed and forgotten. The Valley of the Dark Lords remained as a testament to Sith power, containing the massive sepulchers of ancient Sith Lords such as Marka Ragnos, Tulak Hord, and Ajunta Pall.\n\nDuring the Jedi Civil War, approximately four thousand years before the Empire, the Sith returned to Korriban under Darth Revan, establishing a Sith Academy to train new generations of Dark Jedi. The Academy drew students from across the galaxy, subjecting them to brutal trials within the ancient tombs.\n\nFollowing Revan's defeat, Korriban changed hands multiple times between the Jedi and Sith. The planet was eventually abandoned once more, though it remained a destination for treasure hunters, archaeologists, and those seeking forbidden Sith knowledge.\n\nCenturies later, during the time of the Galactic Republic's twilight years, Korriban was known by some as Moraband. The Jedi Council maintained strict protocols regarding the planet, recognizing the danger posed by its concentration of dark side energy and ancient Sith artifacts.\n\nUnder the Galactic Empire, the planet's location was largely forgotten or deliberately obscured, though Emperor Palpatine himself visited Korriban's tombs in his quest for Sith secrets and power. The planet remains one of the most significant sites in Sith history, a graveyard of ancient evil and a nexus of dark side power."

Their society was organized around strict martial codes and hierarchical command structures, with military service being mandatory for all able-bodied citizens. This warrior culture led the Lortans to repeatedly attempt expansion into neighboring systems, bringing them into conflict with nearby civilizations.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Lorta's aggressive policies made it a problematic world for the Galactic Republic to manage. The Lortans frequently engaged in border skirmishes with neighboring systems, particularly targeting the peaceful Cerean civilization. The Republic was forced to maintain a significant peacekeeping presence in the region to prevent Lortan expansion from destabilizing the entire sector.\n\nThe Lortans' military ambitions were somewhat curtailed by their technological limitations and the Republic's diplomatic and military interventions. However, their expansionist ideology remained deeply ingrained in Lortan society, with each generation raised to believe in their species' manifest destiny to rule surrounding systems.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Lorta remained nominally loyal to the Republic, though their cooperation was often grudging. The Lortans saw the conflict as an opportunity to pursue their own territorial ambitions under the guise of supporting the Republic war effort, leading to tensions with Republic command.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Lorta came under Imperial control. The Empire initially found the Lortans' militaristic culture useful, recruiting many into the Imperial military where their aggressive nature could be channeled toward Imperial objectives.

The native Loth-cats and Loth-wolves roam the grasslands, while the sentient but primitive Loth-rats inhabit the wilderness areas.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Lothal was discovered and lightly settled, developing a modest agricultural economy. The planet maintained a quiet existence for millennia, with most inhabitants living as farmers or working in small manufacturing facilities. Lothal's isolation meant it avoided much of the conflict that engulfed other worlds during various galactic wars.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Lothal remained neutral and largely untouched by the conflict. The planet's distance from major battle zones and lack of strategic resources meant both the Republic and Separatists showed little interest in the world.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Lothal's fate changed dramatically. The Empire recognized the planet's potential for industrial development and its strategic position along the Corellian Trade Spine. Imperial forces arrived on Lothal with promises of economic prosperity, jobs, and security. The planetary government, facing economic difficulties, welcomed the Imperial presence.\n\nThe Empire quickly established a significant presence on Lothal, constructing factories, refineries, and military installations. Imperial industry began exploiting the planet's natural resources, with strip mining and industrial pollution gradually degrading Lothal's once-pristine environment. The promised prosperity proved hollow for most Lothals, as Imperial corporations paid minimal wages while environmental damage destroyed traditional farming livelihoods.\n\nCapital City grew rapidly under Imperial occupation, with towering factories and Imperial architecture transforming the once-modest settlement into a sprawling industrial center. However, the Old Jho's Pit Stop cantina and other local establishments remained as reminders of Lothal's pre-Imperial character.\n\nThe Empire established a major Imperial Academy on Lothal to train officers and stormtroopers. The facility became one of the more significant military training centers in the Outer Rim, producing personnel for deployment throughout Imperial space.\n\nDuring the early years of the Galactic Civil War, Lothal became a hotbed of resistance activity. A small group of rebels led by former Jedi Padawan Kanan Jarrus and his apprentice Ezra Bridger, a native of Lothal, began conducting operations against the Empire. Their actions, including theft of Imperial supplies and the disruption of Imperial operations, drew increasing Imperial attention to the planet.\n\nThe Empire responded to the growing rebellion by tightening security and deploying additional forces. Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin personally visited Lothal to oversee the suppression of rebel activity, demonstrating the Empire's determination to maintain control of this strategically valuable world.\n\nThe rebels continued their resistance despite overwhelming Imperial presence, becoming symbols of hope for Lothal's oppressed population. Their activities included rescuing Wookiee slaves, disrupting Imperial supply lines, and eventually making contact with the wider Rebel Alliance.\n\nImperial Mining operations on Lothal uncovered rare kyber crystals beneath the planet's surface. The Empire established extensive mining operations to extract these crystals for use in various Imperial projects, further devastating Lothal's environment and displacing local communities.\n\nThe rebel cell on Lothal eventually joined forces with the larger Rebel Alliance, escalating their operations against the Empire. Their activities drew the attention of some of the Empire's most dangerous agents, including the Inquisitorius and eventually Darth Vader himself.\n\nThe conflict on Lothal reached a climax when the rebels launched a major offensive to liberate the planet from Imperial control. The battle saw the destruction of the Imperial factories and the death of Grand Admiral Thrawn's forces being pulled into hyperspace along with Thrawn and Ezra Bridger during the confrontation.\n\nFollowing the Empire's defeat at the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Lothal began the long process of recovery.

A harsh, arid world with little surface water and sparse vegetation, Molavar features numerous moisture farms scattered across its dusty landscape, worked by hardy colonists seeking to extract what little water exists in the atmosphere.\n\nThe planet's surface is dominated by rocky terrain and sandy wastes, with settlements concentrated around the few areas where moisture collection is most viable. Despite its inhospitable environment, Molavar developed a modest population drawn by the promise of independence and freedom from the oversight of Core World governments.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Molavar remained a largely ignored frontier world, its remote location and lack of valuable resources keeping it off most galactic charts. The planet attracted settlers seeking to escape the complexities of civilized space, establishing small communities that operated with minimal outside interference.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Molavar's isolation spared it from the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. The planet maintained its quiet existence, with inhabitants focused on the daily struggle of survival in the desert rather than galactic politics.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Molavar fell under nominal Imperial control, though the Empire showed little interest in the barren world beyond ensuring basic compliance with Imperial law. The lack of strategic value or exploitable resources meant Imperial presence remained minimal, with local authorities retaining considerable autonomy.\n\nThe planet became known as a haven for smugglers, bounty hunters, and others seeking to operate outside Imperial scrutiny. Its spaceports, though small and often run-down, served as waypoints for those traveling the lesser-known hyperspace routes of the Outer Rim. These facilities developed reputations as rough, lawless places where questions were rarely asked and Imperial oversight was largely absent.\n\nThe native Molavaran species, adapted to their planet's harsh conditions, made up a significant portion of the population alongside human settlers and various other species drawn to the frontier lifestyle. The Molavarans' intimate knowledge of their world's environment made them valuable guides and traders for offworlders unfamiliar with the planet's dangers.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Molavar remained under loose Imperial control, though the planet's isolation and lack of strategic importance meant it saw little direct involvement in the larger conflict. The Empire maintained only the most basic garrison forces, primarily to monitor traffic through the system's spaceports.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Molavar continued its existence as a remote frontier world, its inhabitants maintaining their independent spirit. The planet's spaceports remained active, serving traders, smugglers, and travelers who preferred to operate away from the scrutiny of major governments."

911002,New, "Manaan is an oceanic planet located in the Pyrshak system of the Inner Rim Territories. The entire surface of the world is covered by a vast, seemingly endless ocean, with no landmasses breaking the waves. Beneath the turbulent surface lies the true civilization of Manaan, built on massive floating platforms and extending down into the ocean depths.\n\nThe planet is home to the Selkath, an amphibious species perfectly adapted to their aquatic environment. The Selkath are known for their diplomatic neutrality and their careful guardianship of Manaan's most precious resource: kolto, a powerful healing fluid with medicinal properties unmatched throughout the galaxy. For millennia, Manaan remained the sole source of kolto, making it one of the most strategically valuable planets in known space.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, during the Jedi Civil War, Manaan became a focal point of conflict as both the Galactic Republic and Darth Revan's Sith Empire sought to secure kolto supplies for their war efforts. The Selkath government maintained strict neutrality, allowing both sides to establish embassies in Ahto City, the planet's capital, while carefully regulating kolto harvesting to prevent ecological damage to the ocean and its native species, including the massive firaxa sharks.\n\nThe kolto itself was produced by the progenitor, an ancient creature dwelling in the depths of Manaan's ocean. The Selkath considered this creature sacred and built their entire civilization around sustainable harvesting of kolto while protecting the progenitor. This delicate balance made Manaan's neutrality crucial, as any disruption to kolto production would have galaxy-wide consequences.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Manaan remained an important medical supplier, though the planet's influence waned somewhat after the discovery of bacta, a more easily produced healing substance. However, kolto retained certain advantages over bacta, and Manaan continued to maintain its position as a valued neutral party in galactic affairs.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Manaan maintained its traditional neutrality, though both the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems sought to secure favorable trade agreements for kolto. The Selkath government carefully balanced these competing interests while protecting their homeworld from becoming embroiled in the conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Manaan came under Imperial oversight. The Empire showed interest in controlling kolto production, though the Selkath's careful management of their resources and the planet's relative isolation helped maintain some degree of autonomy. The Empire established a presence on Manaan but found that heavy-handed tactics risked disrupting the delicate ecological systems that produced kolto.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance recognized Manaan's strategic importance as a medical supplier. The planet remained officially neutral, though individual Selkath held varying sympathies. The Selkath government worked to preserve their independence and protect their ocean world from the conflicts that engulfed much of the galaxy.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Manaan sought to establish new trade relationships while maintaining its traditional neutrality. The planet's unique position as a major kolto supplier ensured continued galactic interest, even as bacta became more widespread. The Selkath remained committed to protecting their ocean home and the ancient progenitor that had sustained their civilization for thousands of years."

A world of varied terrain including plains, forests, and mountain ranges, Manda developed as a relatively minor agricultural and trading center due to its modest resources and remote location.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Manda remained a quiet frontier world, maintaining minimal contact with the broader galactic community. The planet's isolation kept it largely independent of Core Worlds politics, with most inhabitants living simple lives focused on farming and local trade.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Manda maintained neutrality, avoiding entanglement in the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. The planet's distance from major hyperspace routes and limited strategic value meant it saw little direct involvement in the war.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Manda fell under nominal Imperial control, though the Empire maintained only a minimal presence due to the planet's peripheral location and limited economic value. Local authorities retained considerable autonomy in managing day-to-day affairs.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Manda remained under loose Imperial oversight, serving as a minor waypoint for Imperial supply lines operating in the Mid Rim. The planet's isolation from major conflict zones allowed it to avoid much of the devastation that befell other worlds during this period.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the fragmentation of Imperial authority, Manda's status became uncertain as various criminal and corporate factions competed for influence throughout the Mid Rim territories."

Once a lush and verdant world, Mandalore was transformed into a barren wasteland following centuries of warfare and conflict. The planet's surface is dominated by vast deserts of white sand, with scattered domed cities serving as the last refuges of civilization.\n\nThe homeworld of the Mandalorian people, a proud warrior culture known throughout the galaxy for their martial prowess and distinctive armor, Mandalore has a long and turbulent history. The ancient Mandalorians, known as the Taung, originally hailed from Coruscant before migrating to Mandalore thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. Over millennia, the Mandalorians developed a unique culture centered on honor, combat, and clan loyalty.\n\nDuring the Mandalorian Wars, approximately four thousand years before the rise of the Empire, the Mandalorians launched a massive campaign of conquest across the Outer Rim under the leadership of Mandalore the Ultimate. This conflict ended with their defeat at the hands of the Jedi and the Republic at the Battle of Malachor V, leading to centuries of decline for Mandalorian civilization.\n\nThe New Mandalorians, a pacifist government led by Duchess Satine Kryze, rose to power in the years before the Clone Wars, attempting to move Mandalorian society away from its warrior past. The New Mandalorians established their capital in the domed city of Sundari, built upon the planet's barren surface. This peaceful regime faced opposition from the Death Watch, a terrorist organization seeking to restore the warrior traditions of old.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Mandalore maintained official neutrality, though the planet became embroiled in conflict when Death Watch, with the secret backing of Count Dooku and the Separatists, launched attacks against the New Mandalorian government. The criminal Shadow Collective, led by the former Sith Lord Maul, eventually conquered Mandalore by manipulating Death Watch's internal divisions.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Mandalore fell under Imperial occupation. The Empire installed a puppet government and maintained a strong military presence to suppress any resistance. Saxon Clan, collaborators with the Empire, helped enforce Imperial rule over the reluctant Mandalorian population. Many Mandalorians, including members of Clan Wren and other clans, formed resistance movements to fight against Imperial occupation.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Mandalore remained under Imperial control, with the Empire using the planet's strategic location and the Mandalorians' reputation as warriors to their advantage. However, resistance continued throughout this period, with various Mandalorian clans working both openly and covertly against Imperial rule.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Mandalore's status remained contested. Various Imperial remnant factions, New Republic forces, and independent Mandalorian clans competed for control of the planet and the right to determine its future. The ancient weapon known as the Darksaber, a symbol of leadership among Mandalorians, became a focal point in the struggle for power, as whoever wielded it had a claim to rule Mandalore according to tradition.\n\nThe planet's moon, Concordia, once housed mining facilities but was abandoned after the resources were exhausted. Death Watch later used Concordia as a secret base for their operations before their attempt to overthrow the New Mandalorian government.\n\nDespite its harsh environment and troubled history, Mandalore remains a symbol of resilience and warrior pride for Mandalorians scattered throughout the galaxy. Many Mandalorians living off-world maintain their cultural traditions and hope to one day see their homeworld restored to its former glory."

A world of varied terrain including plains, forests, and scattered settlements, Mataou remained largely isolated from major galactic conflicts for much of its history.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Mataou was discovered and settled, though it never developed into a major population center. The planet's remote location and modest resources meant it attracted little attention from Core Worlds governments or major corporations.\n\nAt some point in its history, Mataou fell under the control of the Hutt Cartel, becoming part of the vast criminal empire that dominated much of the Outer Rim. However, the Hutts eventually abandoned their operations on the planet, leaving behind a power vacuum that was filled by various criminal organizations and independent settlers.\n\nThe native Sakiyan species, a humanoid race known for their exceptional tracking abilities and keen senses, established communities on Mataou. The planet also became home to human settlers and other species seeking opportunities on the frontier. These diverse groups coexisted in an uneasy balance, with criminal syndicates operating alongside legitimate farming communities.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Mataou's isolation spared it from the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. The planet maintained its status as a frontier world, largely ignored by both sides of the galactic struggle.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Mataou came under nominal Imperial control. The Empire established a presence on the planet primarily to monitor traffic along the Corellian Trade Spine and maintain order along this important trade route.

The cluster contains numerous black holes in close proximity to each other, creating a treacherous gravitational maze that has claimed countless ships throughout galactic history.\n\nThe exact origins of the Maw's unusual configuration remained a mystery for millennia. Some theorized that the cluster was a natural phenomenon, while others speculated about ancient races deliberately arranging the black holes billions of years ago. The truth, however, was far stranger - the Maw was created by the Killiks as a prison for the dangerous Force entity known as Abeloth.\n\nDue to the extreme gravitational forces and unstable hyperspace routes caused by the black holes' proximity, the Maw is virtually impossible to navigate safely through hyperspace. Only a few treacherous safe routes exist through the cluster, known as the Maw's throat, requiring exceptional piloting skill and detailed knowledge of the constantly shifting paths.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Maw remained largely unexplored and avoided by most spacers. Its dangerous reputation and remote location meant that few ventured into its depths, and those who did rarely returned to tell the tale.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the Empire discovered the Maw's potential as a secret research facility location. The Imperial Maw Installation was constructed deep within the cluster, hidden from the rest of the galaxy by the black holes' natural concealment. Here, some of the Empire's most classified weapons projects were developed, including prototypes for the Death Star's superlaser and other experimental superweapons.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, the Maw Installation continued its research under the leadership of Admiral Daala, who had been placed in command of the facility by Grand Moff Tarkin before his death. The installation remained operational and unknown to both the New Republic and Imperial remnant factions for several years after Endor.\n\nThe Maw's isolation made it an ideal location for secret operations, though the constant danger posed by the black holes meant that even reaching the installation required navigating one of the few stable routes through the cluster, and these routes were known only to select Imperial personnel."

Milagro's economy has long been tied to its role as a major trade nexus, with commerce, manufacturing, and shipping forming the backbone of planetary prosperity.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Milagro was discovered during the early expansion era of the Galactic Republic. Corellian colonists were among the first to recognize the planet's strategic value and established settlements that would grow into thriving commercial centers. The planet joined the Galactic Republic and maintained steady economic growth as trade along both the Corellian Run and Harrin Trade Corridor expanded.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Milagro became known as a regional trade hub, with goods flowing through its spaceports from across the galaxy. The planet's position made it valuable for merchants and shipping companies establishing distribution networks throughout the Expansion Region and beyond. Milagro's shipyards and manufacturing facilities contributed to the galactic economy, producing both civilian and military equipment.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Milagro remained loyal to the Galactic Republic, serving as an important logistics hub for military supply lines. The planet's strategic location meant it saw increased military traffic, though it avoided becoming a major battlefield. Republic forces used Milagro as a staging point for operations throughout the Expansion Region.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Milagro fell under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the planet's economic and strategic importance, establishing a garrison to maintain order and protect vital trade routes. Imperial oversight brought increased regulation to commerce passing through the system, though Milagro's economy continued to benefit from its position as a major trade nexus.\n\nThe Imperial garrison maintained security in the system and ensured compliance with Imperial trade laws. Despite the Imperial presence, Milagro retained much of its commercial character, with traders and merchants from across the galaxy continuing to conduct business through its ports.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Milagro remained under Imperial control for most of the conflict. The planet's location made it strategically valuable to both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, though the strong Imperial garrison deterred major Rebel operations in the system.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the fragmentation of Imperial authority, Milagro's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of key trade routes in the Expansion Region.

The planet's surface is dominated by dense jungles, murky swamps, and treacherous mudflats. Mimban is home to the native Mimbanites, including the surface-dwelling Coway and primitive deep-dwelling tribes.\n\nThe planet's primary value lies in vast deposits of hyperbaride minerals beneath its muddy surface, used in various technological applications. Extracting them from Mimban's hostile environment has proven consistently difficult and costly.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Mimban was home to an ancient civilization that practiced Force traditions distinct from the Jedi. Ruins of their temples, including the legendary Temple of Pomojema, remained scattered across the surface. Among the artifacts left behind was the Kaiburr crystal, a powerful Force-sensitive gem.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Mimban remained largely ignored due to its remote location and inhospitable conditions. Mining corporations occasionally attempted operations to extract valuable minerals, though these ventures frequently failed due to the challenging environment and resistance from the native Mimbanites.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded Mimban to secure its mineral wealth. The Galactic Republic deployed clone troopers to liberate the planet, earning the gratitude of the native population.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, the very soldiers who had once protected Mimban were ordered to subjugate it. The Empire established a significant military presence, constructing facilities and pressing the local population into forced labor in the mines. What had been defended by the Republic became another world crushed under Imperial rule.\n\nThe Empire's occupation proved brutal and prolonged. Imperial garrison bases spread across the surface, though the hostile environment and constant guerrilla resistance from the Mimbanites made full control difficult. The swamps became a quagmire for Imperial forces as the native population waged persistent insurgency.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Mimban served as a battleground between Imperial forces and local resistance fighters. The Empire conducted extensive mining operations, extracting hyperbaride minerals while treating both planet and inhabitants with callous disregard. Soldiers endured constant exposure to muddy terrain, limited visibility due to perpetual fog, and frequent ambushes by resistance fighters and dangerous native creatures. The planet became known among Imperial forces as one of the worst possible postings.\n\nShortly before the Battle of Yavin, the smuggler Han Solo was briefly imprisoned on Mimban after desertion from the Imperial Navy. His experiences reinforced his cynical view of galactic governments and conflicts.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Endor, Imperial control over Mimban weakened considerably, though the planet remained contested. Various Imperial remnant factions sought to maintain control over mining operations, while local resistance groups worked to drive out remaining Imperial presence.\n\nAfter the formation of the New Republic, Mimban's status remained uncertain.

Beneath the turbulent oceans lie sprawling underwater cities built by the planet's two native sentient species: the amphibious Mon Calamari and the squid-headed Quarren.\n\nThe Mon Calamari are known throughout the galaxy for their shipbuilding prowess and peaceful nature, while the Quarren tend to be more conservative and isolationist. Despite their differences and occasional conflicts, the two species have generally coexisted through a shared planetary government, though tensions between them have erupted into violence at various points in history.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Mon Calamari joined the Galactic Republic and became a prominent member world. The planet's shipbuilding industry, centered around Mon Calamari Shipyards, produced elegant vessels known for their organic, flowing designs and exceptional durability. These ships became prized throughout the galaxy for both civilian and military applications.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Mon Calamari remained loyal to the Republic despite brief occupation by Separatist forces. The planet's strategic importance and industrial capacity made it a target for both sides of the conflict. Following the rise of the Galactic Empire, Mon Calamari initially accepted Imperial oversight, though many Mon Calamari were uncomfortable with the authoritarian nature of the new government.\n\nThe Empire's occupation of Mon Calamari proved brutal and exploitative. Imperial forces enslaved much of the population and attempted to adapt Mon Calamari technology for Imperial use, though they never fully succeeded in understanding the unique construction methods. The Mon Calamari and Quarren were forced to work in their own shipyards under Imperial supervision, producing vessels for the Imperial Navy.\n\nThe oppression eventually sparked resistance movements among both species. When the Quarren Isolation League attempted to collaborate with the Empire against the Mon Calamari, it nearly triggered a civil war between the two species. However, Mon Calamari leader Admiral Ackbar helped unite both species against their Imperial oppressors.\n\nMon Calamari's liberation from Imperial rule came through a coordinated uprising supported by the Rebel Alliance. The planet's inhabitants seized control of their shipyards and converted their civilian vessels into warships. Mon Calamari Star Cruisers, retrofitted from luxury liners and passenger ships, became the backbone of the Rebel fleet and some of the most formidable capital ships in the galaxy.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Mon Calamari became one of the Alliance's most important allies and members. The planet's contribution of capital ships and skilled officers, including the legendary Admiral Ackbar, proved crucial to the Rebellion's success. Mon Calamari vessels participated in numerous major battles, including the Battle of Endor where they helped destroy the second Death Star.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Mon Calamari became one of the New Republic's strongest supporters. The planet's shipyards continued producing vessels for the New Republic Defense Fleet, including advanced Star Cruiser designs that improved upon the original wartime conversions. The planet remained a vital economic and military center for the New Republic despite being nominally under Corporate Sector Authority control, with its shipbuilding industry adapting to peacetime production while maintaining the capability to produce warships when needed."

Mon Gazza's economy has long been tied to tourism and entertainment, with gambling establishments and podracing tracks attracting visitors from across the galaxy.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Mon Gazza was discovered and settled, developing a reputation as a destination for those seeking recreation and games of chance. The planet maintained membership in the Galactic Republic for thousands of years, though its focus on entertainment meant it remained somewhat peripheral to major political affairs.\n\nMon Gazza became particularly famous for its podracing events, hosting numerous competitions that drew both professional racers and spectators from throughout the galaxy. The planet's racing circuits were considered among the most challenging and prestigious in the sport, with victories at Mon Gazza bringing significant fame to successful podracers.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Mon Gazza remained under Republic control, though its remote location spared it from major battles. The planet continued to host podracing events and maintain its entertainment industry despite the surrounding galactic conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Mon Gazza came under Imperial oversight.

The planet's surface is dominated by rivers of lava, volcanic peaks, and ash-covered wastelands, making it one of the most inhospitable worlds in the known galaxy. Despite its harsh environment, Mustafar has been inhabited for thousands of years due to the valuable minerals that can be extracted from its lava flows.\n\nThe planet's native species, the insectoid Mustafarians, evolved to survive in this extreme environment, developing heat-resistant exoskeletons and building their settlements on platforms above the lava flows. The Mustafarians are divided into two distinct subspecies: the tall, thin Northern Mustafarians who manage the lava mining operations, and the shorter, stockier Southern Mustafarians who serve as laborers.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Mustafar was discovered by the Techno Union, who recognized the planet's potential for mining valuable ores and crystals from the lava. The Techno Union established massive mining facilities across the planet's surface, employing the native Mustafarians to operate the complex machinery required to extract and process the minerals.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Mustafar remained under Techno Union control and served as a Separatist stronghold. The planet's remote location and hostile environment made it an ideal refuge for Separatist leaders seeking to avoid Republic forces.\n\nAt the end of the Clone Wars, Mustafar became the site of one of the most significant events in galactic history. Following the execution of Order 66 and the transformation of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, the Separatist Council fled to Mustafar, believing they would be safe in the heavily fortified mining facilities. However, the newly anointed Darth Vader arrived on the planet with orders from Emperor Palpatine to eliminate the Separatist leadership.\n\nVader systematically executed the members of the Separatist Council in the main control center of the mining facility, ending the Clone Wars and eliminating the final remnants of the Separatist movement. Following this massacre, Vader's former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, confronted him on Mustafar in a desperate attempt to stop his former apprentice's fall to the dark side.\n\nThe duel between Kenobi and Vader, fought across the treacherous lava flows and collapsing mining structures, resulted in Vader's defeat and severe injuries. Left burning on the shores of a lava river, Vader was rescued by Emperor Palpatine and encased in the black armor that would become synonymous with his reign of terror.\n\nFollowing these events, Mustafar fell under Imperial control. The Empire maintained the mining operations and used the planet as a source of valuable minerals for military production. The Emperor also constructed a fortress on Mustafar for Darth Vader, built on the site where Vader had been defeated by Kenobi. This dark stronghold served as Vader's personal retreat and a place of meditation in the dark side of the Force.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Mustafar remained an Imperial-controlled world, though its strategic importance diminished. The mining operations continued under various Imperial remnant factions, with the native Mustafarians maintaining their role in the extraction and processing of the planet's mineral wealth."

The capital planet of the InterGalactic Banking Clan and homeworld of the Muun species, Muunilinst has served as one of the galaxy's primary financial centers for thousands of years.\n\nThe planet's surface features varied terrain including plains, mountain ranges, and sprawling urban centers dominated by towering financial institutions and corporate headquarters. The native Muuns, known for their extraordinary mathematical abilities and shrewd business acumen, built their civilization around banking, investments, and financial management, establishing Muunilinst as an essential hub for galactic commerce.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Muunilinst joined the Galactic Republic and quickly became its primary financial institution. The InterGalactic Banking Clan, headquartered on Muunilinst, managed Republic credits, financed major projects, and provided loans to governments and corporations throughout the galaxy. The Muuns' reputation for financial expertise made them indispensable to the galactic economy.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Muunilinst maintained strict neutrality in most conflicts, viewing war as detrimental to business interests. However, the Banking Clan's influence grew so substantial that it wielded considerable political power within the Republic Senate, often using its financial leverage to advance Muun interests.\n\nIn the decades before the Clone Wars, tensions between the Republic and various commercial interests grew. San Hill, Chairman of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, began to question the Republic's stability and the security of Muun investments. When Count Dooku founded the Confederacy of Independent Systems, Hill secretly aligned the Banking Clan with the Separatist movement, providing crucial financial backing for their military buildup.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Muunilinst officially declared for the Confederacy, becoming one of the Separatists' most important financial centers. The planet's wealth and the Banking Clan's resources proved vital to sustaining the Separatist war effort. However, this alignment made Muunilinst a priority target for Republic forces.\n\nThe Battle of Muunilinst occurred when Republic forces launched a major assault on the planet to cripple Separatist finances. The battle saw intense fighting both in space and on the planet's surface, with Republic clone troopers engaging battle droids while Republic starfighters dueled Separatist vessels. During this battle, Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi led Republic forces against the formidable bounty hunter Durge. The Republic ultimately claimed victory, dealing a significant blow to Separatist financial operations.\n\nFollowing the Republic's conquest, Muunilinst came under military occupation. The Banking Clan's assets were seized, and San Hill was arrested for his role in funding the Separatist war machine. The occupation proved controversial, as many neutral systems viewed it as the Republic overstepping its authority and interfering in legitimate business operations.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Muunilinst was forcibly integrated into the Imperial financial system. Emperor Palpatine nationalized the Banking Clan, absorbing its assets and using Muunilinst's banking infrastructure to manage Imperial finances. The Muuns, while resentful of their loss of independence, had little choice but to cooperate with the new regime. Imperial oversight brought increased regulation and surveillance to the planet's financial sector.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Muunilinst remained under firm Imperial control due to its financial importance. The Empire maintained a strong garrison to protect the planet's banking institutions and ensure the continued flow of credits to Imperial coffers. However, many Muuns privately sympathized with the Rebel Alliance, though few dared to act on these sympathies given the Empire's heavy presence.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Muunilinst's status became uncertain. Various Imperial remnant factions sought to control the planet and its financial resources, while the New Republic also recognized its strategic importance. The Banking Clan, having operated under Imperial control for decades, worked in the shadows to reestablish its independence."

912102,New, "Mygeeto is a frozen crystalline planet located in the Albarrio sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Covered in ice and dotted with jagged crystal formations, Mygeeto's harsh environment belies its immense strategic and economic value. Beneath the planet's frozen surface lie vast deposits of precious crystals and valuable minerals, making it one of the wealthiest worlds in the galaxy.\n\nThe InterGalactic Banking Clan maintained a significant presence on Mygeeto for thousands of years, using the planet as a repository for some of their most valuable assets. Massive vaults built deep within the ice contained not only credits and treasures, but also artwork, historical artifacts, and other items of immense worth. The Banking Clan's control over Mygeeto's resources made it one of their most important holdings.\n\nThe planet is also home to the native Lurmen species, a peaceful, pacifistic people who prefer to avoid conflict. However, the Banking Clan's exploitation of the planet meant that the Lurmen had little say in the fate of their homeworld.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Mygeeto's allegiance to the Banking Clan meant it fell under Separatist control. The planet became a major Separatist stronghold, with Chairman San Hill overseeing operations from the planet's surface. The Banking Clan's wealth and Mygeeto's strategic location made it a priority target for the Republic.\n\nThe Battle of Mygeeto was one of the final major engagements of the Clone Wars, occurring simultaneously with battles on other Separatist worlds as part of the Republic's final push. Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi led Republic clone troopers in an assault on the planet's crystal cities, fighting through heavy Separatist resistance. The battle was brutal, with fighting taking place among the towering crystal spires and frozen streets.\n\nDuring the battle, Order 66 was executed. Commander Bacara and his clone troopers turned on Ki-Adi-Mundi, killing the Jedi Master on the frozen battlefield. Following the Republic's victory and the rise of the Galactic Empire, Mygeeto fell under Imperial control.\n\nThe Empire maintained a strong presence on Mygeeto to secure the Banking Clan's vaults and the planet's mineral wealth. Imperial forces established garrisons throughout the crystal cities, using the planet's resources to fund Imperial operations. The frozen world remained an important Imperial asset throughout the Galactic Civil War, with its wealth helping to sustain the Imperial war machine.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the fragmentation of Imperial authority, control of Mygeeto became contested between various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic. The planet's immense wealth made it a prize worth fighting for, with multiple factions seeking to claim the Banking Clan's vaults and the crystalline resources buried beneath the ice."

A planet of rolling hills, vast grasslands, and pristine bodies of water, Naboo is renowned for its extraordinary natural beauty and harmonious society.\n\nThe planet is inhabited by two native sentient species. The amphibious Gungans dwell in underwater cities like Otoh Gunga in Lake Paonga, while the human Naboo inhabit elegant surface cities, with Theed serving as the capital.\n\nNaboo's government is unique - an elected constitutional monarchy where the monarch serves alongside the Royal Advisory Council. This democratic approach has created a stable, prosperous society valuing peace, education, and the arts.\n\nApproximately 32 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, this peaceful existence shattered when the Trade Federation, manipulated by Darth Sidious, invaded the planet. Queen Padmé Amidala escaped with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi, encountering young Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine during their journey.\n\nAmidala courageously returned and forged an unprecedented alliance with the Gungan Grand Army led by Boss Nass. This historic cooperation between the two peoples proved decisive in liberating Naboo. The crisis led to Senator Palpatine of Naboo becoming Supreme Chancellor - actually Darth Sidious executing his plan to rule the galaxy.\n\nFollowing her term as Queen, Amidala became Naboo's senator, advocating for peace and democracy. During the Clone Wars, Naboo remained loyal to the Republic despite its pacifist traditions. Amidala's secret marriage to Anakin Skywalker was consummated on Naboo, in the beautiful lake country.\n\nFollowing the Empire's rise, Naboo came under Imperial control. The planet's connection to Emperor Palpatine ensured favorable treatment, though Imperial presence ended democratic processes. Queen Apailana secretly aided surviving Jedi, leading to her assassination by Imperial forces.\n\nDespite occupation, Naboo maintained its cultural identity and beauty. The Empire avoided over-industrialization of their Emperor's homeworld, though Imperial demonstrations became regular occurrences in Theed.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Naboo officially remained loyal to the Empire. Following the Emperor's death at Endor, massive celebrations erupted as citizens tore down Imperial monuments. Many Naboo felt betrayed that their homeworld had produced such evil.\n\nAfter Endor, Naboo allied with the New Republic while still establishing its independence. The monarchy resumed its traditional role, and cooperation between humans and Gungans strengthened as both species worked to ensure their homeworld would never again be used as a tool for galactic domination."

912402,New, "Nal Hutta, known simply as 'Hutta' and formerly called 'Evocar', is a hot, swampy planet located in the Hutt Space region of the Outer Rim Territories. The homeworld of the powerful Hutt species, Nal Hutta orbits the star Ardos within the Y'Toub system, accompanied by five moons including the infamous Smuggler's Moon of Nar Shaddaa.\n\nThe planet's surface is dominated by fetid bogs, stagnant meres, and patches of sickly forest, creating a humid and noxious environment that most species find unpleasant. Ancient metallic structures from the original inhabitants rise from the swamps, now claimed by the Hutts as their palaces and strongholds. The atmosphere itself is polluted and hazy, the result of millennia of industrial activity and deliberate environmental degradation.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Evocar was home to the Evocii, a primitive humanoid species. When the Hutts arrived in the system fleeing the destruction of their original homeworld Varl, they purchased land from the Evocii through a series of treaties and agreements. Over time, through legal manipulation and exploitation, the Hutts gradually acquired the entire planet, eventually relocating the Evocii to Nar Shaddaa. There, the displaced species were forced into servitude and poverty, ultimately devolving over generations due to harsh conditions and exploitation.\n\nThe Hutts terraformed much of Evocar to match the humid, swampy environment of lost Varl, renaming it Nal Hutta, meaning ""Glorious Jewel"" in Huttese. The planet became the center of Hutt Space, a region of the galaxy largely independent from Republic and later Imperial control. From their palaces on Nal Hutta, powerful Hutt crime lords, known as kajidics, conducted their business operations spanning smuggling, slavery, spice trafficking, and countless other illicit enterprises.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Nal Hutta maintained nominal membership in the Galactic Republic while operating with near-complete autonomy. The Republic had little control over Hutt Space, with Senate representatives from the region often serving as mere formalities while the Hutt Grand Council wielded true power. The planet became synonymous with corruption and crime, attracting outlaws, smugglers, bounty hunters, and others seeking to operate beyond the reach of Republic law.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Nal Hutta and the Hutt Cartel maintained official neutrality, though individual Hutts conducted business with both the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet avoided major battles, with the Hutts skillfully playing both sides against each other for profit. Jabba the Hutt, one of the most powerful crime lords of the era, maintained his primary operations from Tatooine but retained significant holdings on Nal Hutta.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Nal Hutta's status remained largely unchanged. Emperor Palpatine, recognizing the impracticality of conquering Hutt Space, negotiated agreements that allowed the Hutts to maintain their independence in exchange for certain concessions and cooperation on matters of Imperial interest. The Empire maintained only a minimal presence in the system, with Hutt crime syndicates continuing to operate openly.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Nal Hutta remained neutral territory, with the Hutts conducting business with the Empire, the Rebel Alliance, and various other factions as opportunities arose. The planet served as a safe haven for criminals and fugitives from across the galaxy, its swamps and palaces hosting countless dealings in contraband, slaves, and information.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the death of Jabba the Hutt, Nal Hutta saw increased competition among Hutt kajidics vying for dominance in the vacuum left by Jabba's demise. The planet remained independent throughout the formation of the New Republic, with the Hutts seeking to expand their criminal enterprises and territorial control over Hutt Space."

A world of varied terrain including plains, forests, and scattered settlements, Nanth'ri remained largely isolated from major galactic conflicts for much of its history.\n\nThe planet maintained a relatively quiet existence during the Old Republic era, serving as a minor agricultural and trade center. Its remote location kept it peripheral to the political intrigues of the Core Worlds.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Nanth'ri's isolation spared it from major battles, though the planet was nominally within Separatist space. The world's inhabitants continued their traditional way of life despite the surrounding galactic turmoil.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Nanth'ri fell under Imperial authority, however given the world's limited strategic importance it was de facto controlled by the Hutt Cartell.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Nanth'ri remained under nominal Imperial control. However, the planet's distance from major conflict zones and lack of significant military infrastructure meant it avoided much of the devastation that befell other worlds during this turbulent period.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the fragmentation of Imperial authority, Nanth'ri's status became uncertain as various Imperial remnant factions, the Hutt Cartel, and the New Republic competed for influence throughout the Mid Rim territories.

912602,Old, "Nar Shaddaa, nicknamed the ""Smuggler's Moon,"" is the notorious moon of the planet Nal Hutta, homeworld of the Hutt species. It is home to a large criminal underworld dominated by bounty hunters and Hutt crime lords."
912602,New, "Nar Shaddaa, known as the ""Smuggler's Moon,"" is the largest moon orbiting the Hutt homeworld of Nal Hutta in the Hutt Space region of the Outer Rim Territories. A massive ecumenopolis entirely covered by urban sprawl, Nar Shaddaa is one of the most infamous worlds in the galaxy, renowned as a haven for smugglers, criminals, and those seeking to operate beyond the reach of galactic law.\n\nThe moon's surface is dominated by towering skyscrapers that reach kilometers into the atmosphere, creating artificial canyons of durasteel and transparisteel. The lower levels, shrouded in perpetual darkness, are home to the poorest inhabitants and most dangerous criminals, while the upper levels host casinos, cantinas, and the palatial estates of crime lords. Unlike the swamps of Nal Hutta below, Nar Shaddaa is entirely urbanized, with no natural environment remaining.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Nar Shaddaa was originally home to the Evocii, the native species of the Nal Hutta system. When the Hutts arrived after the destruction of their original homeworld Varl, they gradually acquired the moon through a series of exploitative treaties and legal manipulations. The Evocii were eventually forced into servitude and poverty, their civilization destroyed by Hutt expansion.\n\nThe Hutts transformed Nar Shaddaa into a massive spaceport and industrial center, using it as a hub for their criminal enterprises while ruling from the swamps of Nal Hutta below. Over millennia, the moon developed into a lawless refuge where any commodity could be bought or sold, and any service obtained for the right price. The Hutt Cartel maintained loose control over the moon, collecting tribute from various criminal organizations while allowing them considerable autonomy.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Nar Shaddaa operated largely outside Republic jurisdiction despite nominal membership in the galactic government. The Republic had minimal presence on the moon, with Hutt influence ensuring that Republic law enforcement could accomplish little. The moon became a major center for the slave trade, spice trafficking, and smuggling operations that supplied illegal goods throughout the galaxy.\n\nThe moon's refugee sector grew over the centuries as beings from across the galaxy fled war, poverty, and persecution, seeking refuge in Nar Shaddaa's shadows. These desperate populations provided cheap labor for the moon's factories and easy recruits for criminal organizations. The refugee sector became one of the most densely populated areas in the known galaxy, with beings living in squalid conditions while crime lords profited from their misery.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Nar Shaddaa remained neutral territory, with the Hutt Cartel refusing to commit to either the Republic or the Separatists. However, individual Hutts conducted business with both sides, selling weapons, supplies, and information to whoever could pay. The moon's shipyards and factories continued producing civilian vessels and equipment, though many of these found their way to both Republic and Separatist forces through black market channels.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Nar Shaddaa's status remained largely unchanged. Emperor Palpatine, recognizing the impracticality of conquering Hutt Space, negotiated agreements that allowed the Hutts to maintain independence in exchange for certain concessions. The Empire maintained only a token presence on Nar Shaddaa, with most Imperial activity limited to pursuing specific high-value targets or conducting covert operations.\n\nThe moon became an even more important haven for those fleeing Imperial persecution, including former Jedi, Rebel sympathizers, and political dissidents. The Empire's inability to effectively police Nar Shaddaa made it a valuable resource for the Rebel Alliance, which used the moon as a source of supplies, intelligence, and recruits. However, the moon's criminal underworld proved as dangerous to Rebels as to Imperials, with bounty hunters and mercenaries hunting Alliance members for profit.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Nar Shaddaa thrived as a neutral ground where representatives of the Empire, Rebel Alliance, and various criminal organizations could conduct business. The moon's cantinas and establishments hosted countless deals and betrayals, with information and contraband flowing freely through its endless corridors and landing bays. Jabba the Hutt maintained significant operations on Nar Shaddaa despite ruling primarily from Tatooine, using the moon as a hub for his far-reaching criminal empire.\n\nThe Black Sun crime syndicate also maintained a strong presence on Nar Shaddaa, competing with the Hutt Cartel for control of various criminal enterprises. The Exchange, another major criminal organization, operated throughout the moon's lower levels, exploiting the desperate refugee populations and maintaining networks of informants and enforcers.\n\nThe moon's red light sector, became infamous throughout the galaxy for its entertainment establishments, many of which operated on the edge of or beyond legal boundaries even by Nar Shaddaa's lax standards. The sector catered to every vice and desire, attracting wealthy patrons from across the galaxy while generating enormous profits for its criminal operators.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the death of Emperor Palpatine, Nar Shaddaa continued its existence as a criminal haven. The formation of the New Republic brought little change to the moon, as the new government proved as unable as the Empire to exert meaningful control over Hutt Space. Following Jabba the Hutt's death, various Hutt kajidics competed for control of his former territories, including holdings on Nar Shaddaa, leading to increased violence and instability.\n\nThe moon remained a vital stopover point for smugglers running the Corellian Run and other major trade routes, its shipyards and repair facilities serving vessels of all types regardless of their origins or cargo. Despite its reputation for danger and lawlessness, or perhaps because of it, Nar Shaddaa continued to attract beings from across the galaxy seeking fortune, freedom, or simply a place to disappear."

A world of varied terrain including mountains, forests, and plains, Nazzri is home to the native Nazzar species, a humanoid race known for their martial traditions and strong sense of honor.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Nazzri became embroiled in galactic conflicts due to its strategic location along the Perlemian Trade Route. During the Great Sith War, approximately four thousand years before the rise of the Empire, the planet was the site of a significant battle as Sith forces sought to control the vital trade corridor. The conflict left lasting scars on Nazzri's infrastructure and population.\n\nCenturies later, during the Mandalorian Wars, Nazzri once again became a battleground as Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders swept through the Mid Rim in their campaign of conquest. The Battle of Nazzri saw intense fighting between Mandalorian forces and Republic defenders, with the Nazzar themselves taking up arms to defend their homeworld. Though the Republic ultimately prevailed, the planet suffered significant damage and loss of life.\n\nFollowing these conflicts, Nazzri recovered slowly, maintaining its membership in the Galactic Republic while developing a reputation for producing skilled warriors and military officers. The Nazzar's martial culture, forged through centuries of defending their world, made them valued recruits for Republic military forces.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Nazzri remained loyal to the Republic, contributing both troops and resources to the war effort. The planet's strategic position along the Perlemian Trade Route made it an important logistics hub for Republic forces operating in the Mid Rim.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Nazzri came under Imperial control. The Empire maintained a garrison on the planet to protect the vital trade route and ensure compliance with Imperial regulations. Many Nazzar continued to serve in military capacities, though now under the Imperial banner rather than the Republic.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Nazzri remained under Imperial control for most of the conflict. However, the planet's population was divided, with some Nazzar supporting the Empire while others sympathized with the Rebel Alliance. The planet's martial traditions meant that whichever side controlled Nazzri gained access to skilled warriors and officers.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Nazzri's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions, criminal syndicates, corporations, and the New Republic competed for control of key positions along the Perlemian Trade Route. The planet's strategic importance ensured it remained a valuable prize in the post-Imperial conflicts that shaped the early years of the New Republic."

The planet's entire economy revolves around funerary services, with undertakers, gravediggers, monument crafters, and various death-care professionals forming the bulk of the living population. The world maintains a somber, reverent atmosphere, with strict regulations governing conduct and commerce.\n\nThe planet's ecosystem includes several species that have adapted to its unique environment. Boneworms, creatures that feed on decaying organic matter, can be found throughout the graveyards, serving an important role in the natural decomposition process. Cryptberries, a plant species that grows among the graves, produce fruit that the local population harvests and processes into various products.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Necropolis maintained its role as a prestigious burial world, with senators, Jedi Masters, war heroes, and wealthy merchants all seeking interment on its hallowed grounds. The planet joined the Galactic Republic early in its history and remained a loyal member world, though its population remained small and focused entirely on mortuary services.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Necropolis continued its traditional function despite the surrounding galactic conflict. The war brought an increased number of burials as casualties mounted, with many Republic officers and clone troopers laid to rest on the tombworld alongside civilians who perished in the conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Necropolis came under Imperial oversight, though the planet's unique purpose meant it received little direct interference. The Empire maintained only a minimal garrison, primarily to ensure order and prevent grave robbing or other criminal activities. Imperial officers and loyalists continued to choose Necropolis for burial, alongside Republic veterans and other citizens.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Necropolis remained largely isolated from the conflict due to its lack of strategic military or economic value. The planet continued to serve its mortuary function for all sides, with Imperial officers, Rebel soldiers, and civilians all finding their final rest among its endless graves.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Necropolis maintained its status as the Core Worlds' premier cemetery world. The planet's vast graveyards now contained the remains of beings from multiple eras of galactic history, serving as a silent monument to all those who had lived and died throughout the millennia of galactic civilization."

The homeworld of the Neimoidian species, Neimoidia is known for its extravagant architecture and ostentatious displays of wealth. The planet's surface features towering bridge cities suspended over deep canyons and valleys, with elaborate spires and platforms connected by graceful arches.\n\nThe Neimoidians are a humanoid species descended from Duro colonists who settled the planet thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. Over time, the harsh environment of Neimoidia shaped their evolution, with grubs competing for limited food supplies creating a culture that emphasized wealth accumulation and personal advancement above all else. This cultural trait would define Neimoidian society for millennia.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Empire, Neimoidia joined the Galactic Republic and quickly became an important commercial center. The Neimoidians proved to be shrewd businesspeople and traders, establishing commercial networks throughout the galaxy. Their natural aptitude for commerce led many Neimoidians to pursue careers in trade and finance.\n\nThe Trade Federation, one of the galaxy's most powerful commercial organizations, came under Neimoidian control, with its leadership dominated by wealthy Neimoidian merchants. The Federation's headquarters were established on Neimoidia, making the planet the center of one of the galaxy's most influential corporate entities. The Neimoidians used their control of the Trade Federation to amass enormous wealth and political influence within the Republic.\n\nDuring the final decades of the Republic, the Trade Federation grew increasingly powerful and brazenly corrupt. Neimoidia became synonymous with corporate greed and political manipulation, with Neimoidian leaders like Nute Gunray using their positions to enrich themselves while exploiting legal loopholes to avoid Republic taxation and regulation.\n\nApproximately 32 years before the rise of the Empire, the Trade Federation, under Neimoidian leadership and secret manipulation by Darth Sidious, blockaded and invaded Naboo. This act, known as the Invasion of Naboo, was ostensibly in protest of taxation of trade routes, though it was actually part of Sidious's grand plan to destabilize the Republic. The invasion failed when Queen Padmé Amidala rallied her people and defeated the droid army, but the incident revealed the extent of Neimoidian willingness to use military force for commercial advantage.\n\nDespite the Trade Federation's role in the Naboo Crisis, Nute Gunray and the Neimoidian leadership escaped serious punishment due to legal maneuvering and corruption within the Republic courts. This failure of justice would have far-reaching consequences for the galaxy.\n\nWhen Count Dooku founded the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Trade Federation, under Neimoidian control, became one of the Separatist movement's most important members. Neimoidia officially joined the Confederacy, providing substantial financial resources and battle droid armies to the Separatist cause. The planet became a major Separatist stronghold and remained so throughout the Clone Wars.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Republic forces launched several campaigns against Neimoidia, recognizing its importance as both a Separatist fortress world and the headquarters of the Trade Federation. The planet's strong defenses and strategic location made it a difficult target, and fighting on Neimoidia was fierce. The famous Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi led Republic forces in attacks on the planet on multiple occasions.\n\nToward the end of the Clone Wars, Neimoidia hosted members of the Separatist Council, who believed the planet's defenses would protect them from Republic attacks. However, following the rise of the Galactic Empire and the execution of Order 66, the Separatist leadership was forced to flee to Mustafar, where they were ultimately executed by Darth Vader.\n\nFollowing the Empire's rise, Neimoidia came under Imperial control. The planet's commercial importance meant the Empire maintained oversight of its economic activities, though the Neimoidians' business acumen ensured they continued to prosper under the new regime. However, the Trade Federation was reorganized and brought under Imperial authority, ending Neimoidian dominance of that organization.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Neimoidia remained under Imperial control, serving as an important commercial center for the Empire. The planet's wealth and industrial capacity contributed to Imperial economic strength, though many Neimoidians privately resented Imperial oversight of their business operations.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Neimoidia's status became contested. The planet's commercial value made it a prize for various factions competing for control in the post-Imperial era.

Their natural aptitude for calculations and data analysis made them highly valued throughout the galaxy as accountants, statisticians, and financial experts. Many Nimbanel left their humid homeworld to pursue careers in banking, commerce, and corporate management on more developed worlds.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Nimban fell under the control of the Hutt Cartel. The Hutts recognized the value of the Nimbanel's analytical skills and incorporated them into their criminal enterprises, employing many as accountants and financial managers for their vast business operations. Despite Hutt dominance, the Nimbanel maintained their own governmental structures on Nimban, though ultimate authority rested with the Hutts.\n\nThe planet's location in Hutt Space meant it remained largely peripheral to major galactic conflicts for much of its history. During the Clone Wars, Nimban, like most of Hutt Space, maintained official neutrality, though individual Nimbanel served various factions throughout the galaxy in financial and administrative capacities.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Nimban remained under Hutt control as the Empire generally avoided direct interference in Hutt Space. However, the Empire recognized the Nimbanel's talents and recruited many to serve in Imperial financial institutions and bureaucratic offices. The Nimbanel's reputation for precision and efficiency made them ideal candidates for managing the Empire's complex economic systems.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Nimban remained in Hutt Space, with the planet continuing its traditional role as a source of financial expertise for various criminal and legitimate organizations throughout the galaxy. The humid world attracted little military attention from either the Empire or the Rebel Alliance due to its lack of strategic military value.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Nimban's status remained largely unchanged.

The primary inhabited world in the system is the planet N'zoth, though the system also contains the moon Y'ness, known for its deposits of kammris, or Adegan crystals, which are prized for their use in lightsaber construction and various technological applications.\n\nN'zoth is the homeworld of the Yevetha, a fiercely xenophobic and militaristic species characterized by their gray skin, six-fingered hands with retractable climbing claws, and prominent cranial horns. Yevethan society is rigidly hierarchical and dominated by males, with the species having developed a complex caste system centered around their concept of ""purity"" and martial prowess. The Yevetha are known for their extreme territorial nature and their practice of ritual suicide rather than accept defeat or dishonor.\n\nFor much of galactic history, N'zoth remained isolated from the broader galactic community due to the Yevetha's hostile attitude toward outsiders. When the Galactic Republic first made contact with the species thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the encounters were marked by violence and mutual distrust. The Yevetha's aggressive nature and unwillingness to engage in peaceful trade or diplomatic relations meant that N'zoth remained largely cut off from galactic civilization.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, the system was occasionally visited by miners seeking kammris crystals from Y'ness, though such expeditions were dangerous due to Yevethan hostility. The Republic maintained minimal contact with N'zoth, recognizing that any attempt to establish permanent presence would likely result in prolonged conflict with the xenophobic Yevetha.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, N'zoth's isolation meant it avoided involvement in the conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Yevetha showed no interest in joining either side, preferring to focus on their own territorial concerns and internal affairs.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, N'zoth's fate changed dramatically. The Empire, recognizing the system's strategic location along the Byss Run and seeing an opportunity to exploit the Yevetha's martial nature, invaded N'zoth and subjugated the species. The Empire established the Black Fifteen shipyards in orbit over N'zoth, a massive construction facility where some of the Empire's most advanced warships were built.\n\nThe Yevetha were pressed into forced labor, working in brutal conditions to construct Imperial vessels. Many Yevetha died in the shipyards, though their resilient nature and natural climbing abilities made them effective, if unwilling, workers in the zero-gravity construction environment. The Empire maintained strict control over N'zoth, viewing the Yevetha as nothing more than expendable labor for their military-industrial complex.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the Black Fifteen shipyards continued operation, producing Star Destroyers and other capital ships for the Imperial Navy. The facility was heavily guarded by Imperial forces, both to protect the valuable shipyards and to prevent Yevethan uprisings. Despite their subjugation, the Yevetha never fully accepted Imperial rule, and resistance movements periodically emerged, though these were brutally suppressed.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, the Imperial presence at N'zoth collapsed as forces were recalled to defend Core Imperial territories. The Yevetha, led by Nil Spaar, seized control of the Black Fifteen shipyards and the Imperial vessels docked there, effectively liberating their homeworld from Imperial occupation.

However, the Empire's control over the planet remained tenuous, with much of Ord Mantell operating as a semi-lawless frontier world. Criminal organizations, particularly the Black Sun syndicate, maintained significant influence in Worlport and other settlements.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Ord Mantell became a contested world. The planet's underworld connections made it attractive to both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance as a source of supplies and information. Shortly after the Battle of Hoth, the bounty hunter IG-88 attempted to capture Han Solo on Ord Mantell, though Solo managed to escape.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Ord Mantell's status remained uncertain.

913302,Old, "Orto Plutonia is a frigid planet located in the Pantora system of the Outer Rim Territories' Sujimis sector. It is orbited by the moon Pantora, which was long believed to be the only inhabited world in the system. It is home to a Talz colony, which was discovered during the Clone Wars following an investigation of a Separatist outpost. After a brief conflict between the Pantorans and the Talz, a peace agreement was reached."
913302,New, "Orto Plutonia is a remote, frigid world located in the Pantora system of the Sujimis sector in the Outer Rim Territories. The planet's surface is perpetually covered in ice and snow, with temperatures well below freezing across most of the landscape. Massive glaciers, frozen tundra, and towering ice formations dominate the terrain, creating a harsh environment inhospitable to most forms of life.\n\nFor much of galactic history, Orto Plutonia was believed to be completely uninhabited. The planet's extreme cold and isolation kept it off most galactic charts, with explorers and colonists showing little interest in the frozen world. Its moon, Pantora, developed into a thriving civilization and became the administrative center of the Pantora system, while Orto Plutonia remained largely ignored.\n\nUnknown to the Pantorans and the wider galaxy, Orto Plutonia was actually home to a indigenous species called the Talz. These tall, furry humanoids were perfectly adapted to the planet's frozen environment, with thick white fur providing insulation against the extreme cold and four eyes that allowed them to see through frequent blizzards. The Talz lived in scattered tribal communities across the planet's icy wastes, maintaining a primitive but sustainable lifestyle based on hunting and gathering.\n\nThe Talz had inhabited Orto Plutonia for thousands of years, developing their own culture and traditions in complete isolation from galactic civilization. They were a peaceful species, though fiercely protective of their territory and way of life. The extreme conditions of their homeworld meant that they rarely ventured far from their settlements, and their primitive technology level meant they had no means of space travel or communication with other worlds.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, approximately 22 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Galactic Republic established a small outpost on Orto Plutonia to monitor Separatist activity in the region. The outpost, manned by clone troopers, was intended to serve as an early warning station should Separatist forces attempt to move through the system.\n\nShortly after its establishment, the Republic outpost lost contact with command. When a relief force arrived to investigate, they discovered that both the Republic outpost and a nearby Separatist outpost had been completely wiped out, with all personnel killed. The discovery of the Separatist outpost confirmed fears that the Confederacy of Independent Systems had been operating in the system.\n\nJedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker were dispatched to investigate the incident, accompanied by Pantoran Chairman Chi Cho and Senator Riyo Chuchi. The investigation revealed that both outposts had been attacked by the native Talz, who viewed the military installations as threats to their territory and way of life. The Talz had emerged from the frozen wilderness to destroy both Republic and Separatist forces, demonstrating surprising military capability despite their primitive technology.\n\nThe revelation that Orto Plutonia was inhabited came as a shock to the Pantorans, who had long believed they were the only sentient species in the system. Chairman Chi Cho immediately claimed Orto Plutonia as Pantoran territory and attempted to assert sovereignty over the planet and its inhabitants. This claim led to tension with the Talz, who had no interest in Pantoran governance and simply wanted to be left alone on their homeworld.\n\nChairman Cho, ignoring the advice of the Jedi and Senator Chuchi, ordered a military strike against the Talz. He led a contingent of clone troopers into the frozen wastes to engage the natives, viewing them as primitives who needed to be brought under Pantoran control. The Talz, defending their homeland, ambushed the Pantoran forces in the ice plains. Despite being armed only with spears and other primitive weapons, the Talz proved to be formidable warriors in their native environment.\n\nDuring the battle, Chairman Cho was mortally wounded by Talz warriors. As he lay dying, Senator Riyo Chuchi convinced him to transfer his authority to her, allowing her to negotiate with the Talz. With the Jedi serving as mediators, Senator Chuchi met with Thi-Sen, the chieftain of the Talz, and apologized for the Pantoran aggression.\n\nIn the negotiations that followed, Senator Chuchi recognized the Talz as the sovereign inhabitants of Orto Plutonia and renounced all Pantoran claims to the planet. The Talz, in return, agreed to peaceful coexistence with Pantora and allowed the Pantorans to maintain a presence on their moon. This diplomatic resolution prevented further bloodshed and established a foundation for peaceful relations between the two species.\n\nThe discovery of the Talz and the subsequent conflict had lasting implications for both species. The Pantorans, who had always viewed Orto Plutonia as part of their domain, were forced to accept that they shared their system with another sentient species. The Talz, meanwhile, gained recognition as a sovereign people, though they continued to avoid contact with the wider galaxy and maintained their traditional way of life on the frozen world below.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the end of the Clone Wars, Orto Plutonia remained under Talz control, with the Empire showing little interest in the frozen world. The planet's extreme environment and lack of valuable resources meant it attracted minimal Imperial attention. The Talz continued their isolated existence, occasionally trading with Pantoran merchants but otherwise avoiding involvement in galactic affairs.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Orto Plutonia's isolation kept it far from the conflict between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Neither side showed interest in establishing a presence on the frozen world, and the Talz were content to remain neutral in the larger struggle.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, the status of Orto Plutonia remained unchanged. The Talz maintained their sovereignty over the planet, living much as they had for thousands of years. The peace agreement established by Senator Chuchi continued to govern relations between the Talz and the Pantorans, with both species respecting the territorial rights of the other."

A planet of strategic military importance, Prakith has served as a stronghold for various galactic powers throughout its long history, most notably the Galactic Empire.\n\nThe planet's surface features varied terrain including mountains, plains, and urban centers, though much of the world has been devoted to military installations, fortifications, and defensive structures. Prakith's strategic location deep within the Core and its position along the Byss Run made it an ideal location for governments seeking secure bases of operations.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Prakith was discovered and developed as a military outpost. During the Old Republic era, the planet served various purposes, though it remained relatively obscure compared to more prominent Core Worlds.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Prakith remained under Republic control, serving as a rear-echelon logistics base far from the fighting on the Outer Rim. The planet's deep Core location meant it saw little direct involvement in the conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Prakith's importance increased dramatically. Emperor Palpatine recognized the planet's strategic value and ordered massive fortifications constructed across its surface. The Empire established Prakith as one of its most secure fortress worlds, second only to the Imperial throneworld of Coruscant itself.\n\nThe Empire constructed extensive military academies, training facilities, and garrison bases on Prakith. The planet became a major center for training Imperial officers and stormtroopers, with its harsh training regimens producing some of the Empire's most capable military personnel. The Imperial presence transformed Prakith into a world devoted almost entirely to military purposes.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Prakith remained firmly under Imperial control throughout the conflict. The planet's deep Core location and massive defensive installations made it virtually impregnable to Rebel attack. Imperial forces used Prakith as a staging point for operations throughout the Deep Core and as a secure location for storing military equipment and supplies.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Prakith became even more significant to the fractured Empire. The planet emerged as the capital world of one of the most powerful Imperial warlords, Admiral Blitzer Harrsk, who controlled a significant portion of the Deep Core.\n\nHarrsk transformed Prakith into the headquarters of his faction of the splintered Empire, using the planet's formidable defenses and strategic location to maintain his independence from other Imperial warlords and the New Republic. From Prakith, Harrsk commanded a fleet of Star Destroyers and controlled numerous systems in the Deep Core region.\n\nThe planet's military infrastructure, already substantial under the united Empire, was further reinforced under Harrsk's rule. Prakith's orbital defenses included massive space stations, mine fields, and squadrons of TIE fighters, making any assault on the world a daunting prospect even for the New Republic's battle-hardened forces.\n\nPrakith remained a significant Imperial holdout well after the formation of the New Republic, with Admiral Harrsk refusing to surrender or negotiate with the new government. The planet continued to serve as a symbol of Imperial resistance and a reminder that, despite the Empire's defeat at Endor, significant Imperial forces remained capable of defending their territories in the galaxy's most heavily fortified regions. It took a multi-year long siege to finally break the Imperial remnant occupation and flip control of this stronghold to the New Republic."

Once a lush, green world with fertile land and abundant resources, Parnassos was discovered and colonized by the Con Star Mining Corporation, which established operations to extract the planet's valuable minerals.\n\nFor a time, the mining colony thrived, with workers and their families settling on Parnassos to build a new life. The corporation constructed facilities and infrastructure to support the mining operations, and the colonists worked tirelessly to extract resources for export throughout the galaxy.\n\nHowever, disaster struck when a catastrophic nuclear accident occurred at one of the mining facilities. The exact details of the incident remain unclear, but the resulting environmental devastation was severe and irreversible. Massive amounts of radiation contaminated large portions of the planet's surface, poisoning the soil, water, and atmosphere.\n\nIn the aftermath of the disaster, the Con Star Mining Corporation made the callous decision to abandon Parnassos entirely. The corporation evacuated its executives and essential personnel, but left behind the majority of the colonists - workers and their families who had devoted their lives to the mining operations. These abandoned colonists found themselves stranded on a dying world, with no means of escape and limited resources.\n\nThe nuclear fallout transformed Parnassos from a verdant world into a harsh, barren wasteland. Much of the planet's vegetation withered and died, leaving behind vast stretches of contaminated desert. The once-blue skies became perpetually hazy with radiation and dust. The colonists who remained were forced to adapt to this new, hostile environment or perish.\n\nThe survivors organized themselves into small communities, scavenging among the ruins of the abandoned mining facilities for supplies, equipment, and anything that could be salvaged. Life on post-disaster Parnassos became a daily struggle for survival, with clean water and uncontaminated food becoming precious commodities. Many colonists succumbed to radiation sickness, starvation, or the harsh conditions.\n\nOver time, the descendants of the original colonists developed a hardscrabble existence, forming tribes and clans that competed for control of the scarce resources that remained. These groups often came into conflict with one another, fighting over salvage, water sources, and whatever edible materials could be found in the wasteland.\n\nThe planet's abandonment and isolation in the Unknown Regions meant that Parnassos remained largely forgotten by the rest of the galaxy. Few ships ventured to the remote world, and those that did found little reason to remain. The planet became a symbol of corporate greed and the human cost of industrial exploitation, though few in the wider galaxy were aware of its tragic history.\n\nDespite the devastation, the people of Parnassos proved remarkably resilient, developing survival skills and adaptations that allowed them to endure in one of the galaxy's most inhospitable environments. The harsh conditions of their world forged them into tough, resourceful survivors, though they remained trapped on a planet that had been poisoned by the very corporation that had brought their ancestors there."

Quermian society placed great value on libraries and centers of learning, with many settlements built around these intellectual institutions.\n\nOne of the most notable Quermians in galactic history was Yarael Poof, who served on the Jedi High Council during the final years of the Galactic Republic. Master Poof was renowned for his wisdom, his mastery of mind tricks and illusions, and his dedication to the Jedi Order's principles. His presence on the Council demonstrated the respect the Quermian species commanded throughout the galaxy.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Quermia remained loyal to the Galactic Republic. The planet contributed to the war effort primarily through diplomatic channels and logistical support rather than military forces, consistent with the Quermian philosophy of peaceful conflict resolution. However, the planet's inhabitants recognized the existential threat posed by the Separatist movement and supported the Republic's defense.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Quermia fell under Imperial authority. The Empire established a presence on the planet to maintain order and collect taxes, though the garrison remained relatively modest given the world's peaceful nature and lack of strategic military value. Many Quermians found the Empire's authoritarian policies deeply troubling, particularly its suppression of free thought and academic inquiry.\n\nThe Jedi Purge that accompanied the Empire's rise had a profound impact on Quermian society, as the loss of Jedi like Yarael Poof represented not just a tragedy for the Order but also for Quermian culture. The species had long admired the Jedi's pursuit of knowledge and peaceful guardianship of the Republic, and the Empire's campaign against them was viewed with horror by many Quermians.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Quermia remained under nominal Imperial control, though individual Quermians held varying sympathies regarding the conflict. Some supported the Empire's promise of order and stability, while others were drawn to the Rebel Alliance's fight for freedom and the restoration of democratic governance. The planet's academic institutions became quiet centers of resistance, with scholars and intellectuals preserving knowledge and ideas that the Empire sought to suppress.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Quermia sat firmly under Corporate Sector Authority control. Nevertheless the planet's leaders and intellectuals contributed to the development of the New Republic's governmental structures and educational policies, hoping to help create a galaxy that valued knowledge, reason, and peaceful coexistence as their species had always done."

914602,Old, "Rago is a planet located near the border of Wild Space and the Mid Rim that anchored the Rago Run to the Unknown Regions. It is the closest Galactic Alliance planet to the Colony of the Killiks."
914602,New, "Rago is a terrestrial planet located in the Rago system near the border of Wild Space and the Mid Rim Territories. The planet anchored the Rago Run, a hyperspace route that extended into the Unknown Regions, making it one of the closest inhabited worlds to unexplored space.\n\nLittle is known about this sparsely populated world, as it remained largely isolated from major galactic events throughout its recorded history. The planet's remote location and limited resources meant it attracted minimal attention from Core Worlds governments or major corporations.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Rago served primarily as a waypoint for explorers and traders venturing into the Unknown Regions. The planet maintained a small population of frontier colonists who established modest settlements to support passing vessels.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Rago's isolation spared it from the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. The planet continued its quiet existence on the fringes of known space, largely unaffected by the galactic struggle.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Rago fell under nominal Imperial authority, though the Empire maintained only a minimal presence due to the planet's peripheral location and limited strategic value. Local authorities retained considerable autonomy in managing day-to-day affairs.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Rago remained under loose Imperial oversight, serving occasionally as a staging point for Imperial scouts exploring the Unknown Regions. The planet's distance from major conflict zones allowed it to avoid much of the devastation that befell other worlds during this turbulent period.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Rago's status became uncertain as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for influence throughout the frontier territories. The planet's position along the Rago Run ensured it maintained some strategic relevance as a gateway to the Unknown Regions."

914702,Old, "Rakata Prime, also known as Lehon, was the homeworld of the long-extinct Rakata species, who were rumored to be the first to develop hyperspace travel, and is one of the few navigable worlds located in the Unknown Regions."
914702,New, "Rakata Prime, also known as 'Lehon' or 'the Unknown World', is a mysterious oceanic planet located in the Lehon system of the Tempered Wastes in the Unknown Regions. The world is almost entirely covered by ocean, with only scattered tropical islands breaking the surface of the endless seas.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Rakata Prime was the throneworld of the Infinite Empire, ruled by the technologically advanced and Force-sensitive Rakata species. The Rakata were among the first species to develop hyperdrive technology and used their mastery of the Force to conquer and enslave countless worlds throughout the galaxy. At the height of their power, the Infinite Empire stretched across much of known space, with Rakata Prime serving as its capital.\n\nThe Rakata constructed massive edifices on their homeworld, including temples and facilities that harnessed the dark side of the Force. Most notable among these was the Star Forge, an ancient space station of Rakatan design that orbited the planet. The Star Forge was capable of producing an endless supply of ships and war material by drawing energy directly from nearby stars and channeling the dark side energies of its Rakatan crew.\n\nApproximately 25,000 years before the rise of the Empire, the Infinite Empire collapsed catastrophically. A plague swept through the Rakata species, and they mysteriously lost their connection to the Force. Without their Force abilities, the Rakata could no longer maintain their technology or control their slave populations. Slave revolts erupted across the Infinite Empire, and the once-mighty civilization crumbled. The Rakata who survived on their homeworld regressed to a primitive tribal state, while knowledge of Rakata Prime's location was lost to the galaxy at large.\n\nFor millennia, Rakata Prime remained hidden in the Unknown Regions, its existence becoming the stuff of legend. The descendants of the Rakata split into two main tribes: the Elders, who sought to reclaim their ancestors' peaceful traditions, and the more numerous tribal Rakata, who embraced violence and warfare. These tribes warred with each other for thousands of years among the ruins of their once-great civilization.\n\nDuring the Jedi Civil War, approximately 3,956 years before the rise of the Empire, Darth Revan and Darth Malak rediscovered Rakata Prime and the Star Forge. Malak used the ancient station to produce an endless fleet of warships for his Sith Empire. The planet became the site of a crucial battle when the redeemed Revan returned with the Republic fleet to destroy the Star Forge. After a massive space battle in orbit, the Star Forge was destroyed, ending its threat to the galaxy.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Star Forge, Rakata Prime once again faded into obscurity. The planet's location remained largely forgotten, known only to a handful of scholars and explorers. The native Rakata continued their existence on the tropical islands, their numbers dwindling over the centuries.\n\nThe dangerous anomalies and strange energy readings surrounding the Lehon system, combined with its location deep in the Unknown Regions, continued to discourage exploration even by those few who might have heard legends of the Unknown World. The system remained effectively isolated from the rest of the galaxy throughout the rise of the Galactic Empire and the subsequent Galactic Civil War.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Rakata Prime remained one of the galaxy's most elusive mysteries, its ruins holding secrets of an ancient civilization that had once ruled the stars through their mastery of both technology and the Force."

914802,Old, "Randon is a planet from which the Randoni originated. It's a large business world with crowded bazaars and elegant corporate towers. It's at the intersection with several major trade routes, including the Trax Tube, Ootmian Pabol, Pabol Sleheyron, and the Randon Run."
914802,New, "Randon is an unremarkable terrestrial planet located in the Randon system of the Outer Rim Territories, positioned at the strategic intersection of multiple major hyperspace routes including the Trax Tube, Ootmian Pabol, Pabol Sleheyron, and the Randon Run. This convergence of trade lanes has made Randon a significant waypoint for commerce despite the planet's lack of inherent resources or manufacturing capability.\n\nThe planet's surface features varied terrain including plains, forests, and scattered urban centers that developed around trade hubs and spaceports. Randon's economy has long been tied entirely to its role as a crossroads world, with merchant activity and transshipment forming the backbone of what modest prosperity the planet enjoys.\n\nThe native Randoni species, humanoid beings who evolved on the planet, have built their civilization around facilitating trade and providing services to the constant flow of travelers passing through their system. Randon's cities feature crowded bazaars filled with goods from across the galaxy, alongside corporate towers housing the regional offices of various trading companies seeking to capitalize on the planet's position.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Randon was discovered during the early expansion of galactic trade routes. The planet joined the Galactic Republic, though its membership was largely nominal given its distance from the Core Worlds and its limited political influence. Randon maintained steady but unremarkable growth as the various trade routes passing through the system expanded over the millennia.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Randon served primarily as a rest stop and transfer point for merchants moving goods between different regions of the galaxy. The planet never developed significant manufacturing or agriculture, instead importing most necessities and exporting nothing but services to passing vessels. This dependence on trade traffic made Randon's economy vulnerable to disruptions in galactic commerce.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Randon maintained official neutrality, seeking to preserve trade relationships with both the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, the planet's location meant that control of the system changed hands several times during the conflict, with neither side maintaining a permanent presence. The fighting disrupted trade significantly, causing economic hardship for the Randoni population.\n\nFollowing the Clone Wars and the subsequent rise of the Galactic Empire, Randon fell under the sphere of influence of the Hutt Cartel rather than direct Imperial control. The Hutts had long maintained criminal operations in the region, and the Empire's focus on more strategically important systems allowed the Hutts to extend their reach. The Hutt presence on Randon remained relatively sparse, with local criminal bosses collecting tribute from merchants and establishments while the Randoni continued to manage day-to-day trade operations.\n\nThis arrangement suited both the Hutts and the local population. The Hutts gained access to a valuable trade nexus without the expense of maintaining a large occupation force, while the Randoni preserved a degree of autonomy in exchange for regular payments and cooperation with Hutt business interests. Imperial authorities maintained only a token presence on Randon, generally allowing the Hutts to manage affairs as long as trade continued to flow and no overt challenges to Imperial authority emerged.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Randon's position under Hutt control meant it remained neutral territory where merchants, smugglers, and even military vessels from both sides could conduct business. The planet's lack of military significance and the Hutts' preference for profitable neutrality ensured that Randon avoided becoming a battleground, though the conflict disrupted some trade routes passing through the system.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Randon's status remained largely unchanged. The Hutt Cartel continued its sparse occupation, the Randoni continued facilitating trade, and the planet maintained its character as an unremarkable but strategically positioned crossroads world. Various factions showed limited interest in Randon beyond ensuring their merchant vessels could pass through safely, recognizing that the planet's only value lay in its location rather than any inherent resources or military importance."

914902,Old, "Rendili is a planet in the Core Worlds and one of the Core Founders of the Galactic Republic. The planet is ruled by an Arch-Provost. It is the headquarters of Rendili StarDrive, founded in 20,000 BBY, and is affiliated with the starshipwrights Rendili Hyperworks,Rendili/Vanjervalis Drive Yards and Golan Arms joint venture."
914902,New, "Rendili is a heavily industrialized planet located in the Core Worlds region of the galaxy, positioned along the Hydian Way hyperlane. One of the Core Founders of the Galactic Republic, Rendili has played a crucial role in galactic politics and military affairs for over 25,000 years. The planet is ruled by an Arch-Provost, a position of significant political authority within both planetary and Republic governance.\n\nRendili is best known as the headquarters of Rendili StarDrive, one of the galaxy's premier starship manufacturers, founded approximately 20,000 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. The corporation is affiliated with several subsidiary companies including Rendili Hyperworks, Rendili/Vanjervalis Drive Yards, and maintains a joint venture with Golan Arms. Together, these companies have produced some of the most iconic warships in galactic history.\n\nThe planet's surface is dominated by vast shipyards, manufacturing facilities, and urban centers devoted to starship construction and related industries. Rendili's orbital space is equally industrialized, with massive construction facilities capable of building capital ships of all sizes. The planet's economy has been intrinsically tied to military and commercial shipbuilding for millennia, making it one of the wealthiest and most strategically important worlds in the Core.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Empire, Rendili StarDrive established itself as a major competitor to Kuat Drive Yards and the Corellian Engineering Corporation. The company's designs emphasized durability and firepower, producing vessels that served with distinction in countless conflicts throughout galactic history. Rendili's Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser, introduced approximately 4,000 years before the rise of the Empire, became one of the most widely used capital ships in the Republic Navy and remained in service for millennia.\n\nDuring the Mandalorian Wars and the subsequent Jedi Civil War, Rendili StarDrive provided substantial numbers of warships to the Republic, helping to combat first the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders and later Darth Revan's Sith Empire. The planet's industrial capacity proved crucial during these conflicts, with Rendili's shipyards working around the clock to replace Republic losses.\n\nThroughout the Old Republic era, Rendili maintained its position as one of the Republic's most important military contractors. The planet's political leadership wielded considerable influence in the Senate, often using that power to secure lucrative contracts and favorable trade agreements. Rendili's status as a Core Founder gave it additional prestige and ensured that Republic leadership took the planet's interests seriously.\n\nIn the decades before the Clone Wars, Rendili StarDrive faced increasing competition from other major shipbuilders, particularly Kuat Drive Yards. The company responded by developing new designs and updating older vessels, but financial pressures began to mount. The corporation's reliance on the aging Dreadnaught design, while economically sensible given the vast numbers already in service, limited opportunities for lucrative new contracts.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Rendili initially remained loyal to the Republic, with Rendili StarDrive producing warships for the Republic Navy. However, approximately two years into the conflict, political tensions came to a head when Captain Jace Dallin, commander of the Rendili Home Defense Fleet, initiated a mutiny. Dallin, supported by elements of Rendili's government including Arch-Provost Tessen Harvus, declared the planet's intention to secede to the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n\nThe Rendili crisis brought Republic and Separatist forces into direct confrontation in the Core Worlds, threatening to shift the entire momentum of the war. Jedi Generals Saesee Tiin, Plo Koon, and Obi-Wan Kenobi were dispatched to resolve the situation. Through a combination of negotiation and limited military action, the Jedi succeeded in preventing Rendili's secession, though only after a tense standoff that could have erupted into full-scale battle.\n\nCaptain Dallin and other mutineers were placed under arrest, and Arch-Provost Harvus was removed from power. The incident revealed deep divisions within Rendili's population and government, with some factions harboring significant resentment toward the Republic's wartime policies and the economic strain placed on the planet's industries. Despite the resolution of the immediate crisis, Rendili's loyalty remained somewhat questionable for the remainder of the war.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Rendili came under Imperial control. The Empire recognized the planet's vital shipbuilding capacity and moved quickly to secure its loyalty and productivity. Rendili StarDrive became a major Imperial contractor, producing vessels for the Imperial Navy throughout the era of the New Order. The company's Victory-class Star Destroyer design, originally developed during the Clone Wars, became one of the most numerous capital ships in the Imperial fleet.\n\nUnder Imperial rule, Rendili's government was reorganized, with Imperial oversight ensuring that production quotas were met and that there would be no repeat of the Clone Wars mutiny. The Empire maintained a significant military presence on the planet to protect the valuable shipyards and prevent any potential resistance movements from disrupting operations.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Rendili remained firmly under Imperial control for most of the conflict. The planet's shipyards continued producing vessels for the Imperial Navy, contributing to the Empire's military strength despite the growing Rebel threat. However, as the war progressed and the Empire's authority began to fracture following the Battle of Endor, Rendili's status became increasingly uncertain.\n\nAfter the Emperor's death at the Battle of Endor, various Imperial warlords and the New Republic competed for control of Rendili's valuable shipbuilding facilities. The planet changed hands several times during the conflicts that followed, with different factions recognizing that controlling Rendili meant controlling a significant portion of the galaxy's military-industrial capacity. Rendili StarDrive continued to operate throughout this period, adapting to serve whichever faction held the planet while attempting to preserve the company's long-term interests.\n\nDespite the political upheaval, Rendili's position as one of the galaxy's premier shipbuilding centers remained secure. The planet's thousands of years of experience in starship construction, combined with its extensive facilities and skilled workforce, ensured that regardless of which government controlled the Core Worlds, Rendili would continue to play a crucial role in galactic affairs."

Many Verpine colonies in the asteroids joined the Galactic Republic in its early years, and remained loyal through the Clone Wars. Roche is home to Slayn and Korpil, the manufacturer of the V-19 Torrent and B-wing starfighter."
915102,New, "Roche is an asteroid field located in the Roche system of the Mid Rim Territories. A dense collection of asteroids orbiting a yellow star, the Roche asteroid field is the homeworld of the Verpine, an insectoid species known throughout the galaxy for their exceptional technical skills and innovative starship designs.\n\nThe Verpine are a communal species who communicate through organic radio waves, allowing them to coordinate complex tasks with remarkable efficiency. They live within hollowed-out asteroids, creating elaborate underground cities and manufacturing facilities within the rocky bodies. The Verpine claim not to know the origin of their species or whether Roche was always an asteroid field, though some xenobiologists theorize the field may be the remnants of a destroyed planet that was once the Verpine homeworld.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, various Verpine colonies within the Roche asteroid field joined the Galactic Republic. The Verpine's natural aptitude for engineering and manufacturing made them valuable members of the Republic, with Verpine technicians and designers becoming highly sought after throughout the galaxy. Their ability to work in zero-gravity environments and manipulate delicate components with their dexterous appendages made them ideal starship designers and mechanics.\n\nThe Roche system is home to Slayn and Korpil, one of the galaxy's most innovative starfighter manufacturers. Founded by a partnership between Verpine engineers and other species, the company established major manufacturing facilities within several of the larger asteroids. During the Clone Wars, Slayn and Korpil produced the Fang-class starfighter and contributed to the development of various Republic military technologies.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Roche asteroid field remained firmly loyal to the Galactic Republic. The Verpine's communal decision-making process, conducted through their unique radio-wave communication, resulted in unanimous support for the Republic cause. Slayn and Korpil's facilities produced military hardware for the Republic throughout the conflict, including components for various starfighter designs.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Roche asteroid field came under Imperial oversight. The Empire recognized the strategic value of the Verpine's technical expertise and Slayn and Korpil's manufacturing capabilities. Imperial authorities established a presence in the system to ensure continued production and prevent any resistance activities, though the Verpine's communal nature made traditional occupation difficult.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the Verpine found themselves torn between their natural inclination toward peaceful cooperation and their discomfort with the Empire's authoritarian policies. While the Roche system remained officially under Imperial control, many individual Verpine secretly sympathized with the Rebel Alliance. Some Verpine technicians and engineers defected to the Rebellion, bringing their expertise to bear in developing new technologies for the Alliance.\n\nMost notably, the Verpine provided crucial assistance in developing the B-wing starfighter, one of the Rebel Alliance's most powerful assault starfighters. This heavy assault fighter, designed in collaboration with Admiral Ackbar, featured innovative Verpine engineering including a unique gyroscopic cockpit and devastating firepower. The B-wing proved highly effective against Imperial capital ships and became a key component of the Rebel fleet.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, the Roche asteroid field came under Corporate Sector Authority control. The Verpine continued to contribute their technical expertise to the New Republic Defense Fleet. Slayn and Korpil resumed production of civilian and military vessels, adapting their designs for the post-Imperial era.\n\nThe Roche asteroid field's unique environment and the Verpine's communal society continue to make it one of the most distinctive locations in the Mid Rim, with their engineering innovations influencing starship design throughout the galaxy."

915202,Old, "Roqoo is a star in the Hapes Cluster, in the Inner Rim. The solar winds of this blue giant interact with the Transitory Mists surrounding the cluster to create magnificent auroras."
915202,New, "Roqoo is a blue giant star located within the Hapes Cluster in the Inner Rim Territories. The system is best known for the Roqoo Depot, a massive military installation and supply base constructed by the Hapes Consortium. The depot is positioned in orbit around the star and serves as a central hub for the Hapan Royal Navy, supporting fleet operations and logistics throughout the cluster.\n\nThe Roqoo system is surrounded by the Transitory Mists, a dense and hazardous nebula that envelops the Hapes Cluster. The interaction between Roqoo's solar winds and the Mists creates spectacular auroras visible from the system's orbital facilities. The Mists also serve as a natural barrier, making navigation into and out of the Hapes Cluster extremely difficult for outsiders and providing the Consortium with a strategic defensive advantage.\n\nRoqoo Depot is heavily fortified and restricted, with access limited to authorized Hapan military personnel. The installation includes repair docks, supply warehouses, and command centers, supporting the Consortium's fleet of Battle Dragons and Nova-class battle cruisers. The depot's location near the center of the cluster allows rapid deployment of Hapan forces to any of the inhabited worlds within Hapes territory.\n\nThe system itself is sparsely populated, with no major civilian settlements. Its primary significance is military, and the Consortium maintains strict security protocols to protect the depot and its operations. The Roqoo system's strategic importance and isolation have made it a key asset in the defense of Hapan space, ensuring the Consortium's continued independence and security throughout the era of the Galactic Empire and into the early years of the New Republic."

915302,Old, "Rorak is an industrial world in Hutt Space. Having been under the control of the Hutts for more than ten thousand years, it is home to many smugglers and pirates, and the largest slave market in Hutt Space."
915302,New, "Rorak 4 is a terrestrial planet located in Hutt Space within the Outer Rim Territories. A harsh, arid world dominated by rocky deserts and industrial sprawl, Rorak 4 has been under Hutt control for over ten thousand years, serving as one of the Hutt Cartel's most important commercial and criminal centers.\n\nThe planet's surface is covered with factories, warehouses, and various industrial facilities that produce goods ranging from legitimate merchandise to illegal contraband. The atmosphere is polluted from millennia of unregulated industrial activity, creating a perpetual haze over many urban areas. Despite these harsh conditions, Rorak 4 maintains a substantial population drawn by economic opportunities and the relative freedom from galactic law enforcement.\n\nRorak 4 is perhaps most infamous for hosting the largest slave market in Hutt Space, a grim distinction that has persisted for thousands of years. The planet's slave trade operates openly under Hutt protection, with beings from across the galaxy bought and sold in massive auction houses. The Hutts maintain strict control over the slave market, collecting substantial profits while ensuring that this lucrative business continues uninterrupted.\n\nThe planet serves as a major hub for smugglers, pirates, and other criminal elements operating throughout Hutt Space. Its spaceports are notorious for asking few questions and maintaining minimal security protocols, making Rorak 4 an ideal location for conducting illicit business away from the scrutiny of galactic authorities. The Hutts encourage this criminal activity, as it generates substantial revenue through various ""protection fees"" and bribes.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Rorak 4 remained firmly under Hutt control, with the Galactic Republic showing little interest in challenging Hutt dominance over the planet. The Republic's inability or unwillingness to suppress the slave trade on Rorak 4 was a source of ongoing controversy within the Senate, though practical concerns about the difficulty of projecting power into Hutt Space prevented meaningful action.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Rorak 4 maintained its position as a neutral territory within Hutt Space. The planet continued its traditional role as a center for criminal commerce, with both Republic and Separatist agents occasionally conducting covert operations or transactions on its surface. The slave trade continued throughout this period, with the chaos of the galactic war providing the Hutts with even more opportunities to acquire slaves from war-torn worlds.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Rorak 4's status remained largely unchanged. Emperor Palpatine, recognizing the impracticality of conquering Hutt Space, negotiated agreements that allowed the Hutts to maintain their independence in exchange for certain concessions. The Empire turned a blind eye to the activities on Rorak 4, including the slave trade, as long as the Hutts cooperated with Imperial interests when required.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Rorak 4 became an important location for both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance to conduct covert business. The planet's neutral status and the Hutts' willingness to deal with anyone who could pay made it valuable for acquiring supplies, information, and services that might not be available through official channels. Rebel agents occasionally used Rorak 4 as a meeting point for clandestine operations, while Imperial intelligence officers worked to identify and capture Alliance operatives on the planet.\n\nThe slave market on Rorak 4 continued to operate throughout the Galactic Civil War, though the conflict created complex moral dilemmas for Rebel personnel who needed to conduct business on the planet. Some Alliance members advocated for operations to disrupt or destroy the slave trade, while others argued that maintaining access to Rorak 4's resources and intelligence networks was strategically necessary despite the moral compromises involved.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Rorak 4 remained under Hutt control. The New Republic faced the same challenges as the old Republic in dealing with Hutt Space, lacking the military resources to challenge Hutt dominance while dealing with Imperial remnants elsewhere in the galaxy. The slave market continued to operate, though the New Republic worked diplomatically to pressure the Hutts into reducing the scale of the trade.\n\nThe planet's industrial facilities continued to produce goods for markets throughout the Outer Rim, with legitimate businesses operating alongside criminal enterprises in an uneasy coexistence that had characterized Rorak 4 for millennia. The Hutts maintained their iron grip on the planet, ensuring that Rorak 4 remained one of their most profitable holdings and a symbol of their enduring power in the Outer Rim."

915402,Old, "Rutan is a terrestrial world in the Outer Rim. It was home to the Rutanian people, who frequently warred with the Senali people of Rutan's moon. Eventually they made peace, exchanging firstborn royalty for a time to prevent each other from attacking."
915402,New, "Rutan is a terrestrial planet located in the Rutan system of the Outer Rim Territories. The system contains two inhabited worlds: Rutan itself and its moon Senali. Both worlds are home to human populations who share a common ancestry but developed distinct cultures over thousands of years of separation.\n\nRutan's surface features varied terrain including forests, plains, and mountain ranges, with a climate suitable for human habitation. The planet developed a monarchical government, with power concentrated in the hands of the royal family who ruled from the capital city. Rutanian society placed great emphasis on tradition, protocol, and maintaining the established social order.\n\nFor much of its history, Rutan maintained an antagonistic relationship with Senali. The two worlds engaged in periodic conflicts and cold wars, with each viewing the other with suspicion and distrust. Cultural differences between the formal, tradition-bound Rutanians and the more egalitarian Senali contributed to ongoing tensions.\n\nApproximately sixteen years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, King Frane of Rutan and the Senali leadership negotiated a peace agreement intended to prevent future conflicts. The treaty established a unique arrangement: the firstborn children of the ruling families of both worlds would be exchanged and raised on the other world until they came of age. This practice was designed to foster understanding between the two cultures and create personal bonds that would make future wars less likely.\n\nUnder this agreement, Prince Leed, the heir to the Rutanian throne and son of King Frane, was sent to Senali as a young child. He was raised by a Senali family and adopted their customs and way of life. Similarly, the firstborn of prominent Senali families were sent to Rutan to be raised in Rutanian traditions.\n\nThe exchange program proved controversial on both worlds, with some viewing it as an effective peace measure while others saw it as an abandonment of cultural identity. On Rutan, the royal court maintained strict adherence to protocol and tradition, creating tension with those who had been raised on Senali and returned with different values.\n\nWhen Prince Leed came of age and was scheduled to return to Rutan to assume his role as heir, complications arose. Having been raised on Senali and having fully adopted their culture, Leed had no desire to return to Rutan and assume the throne. He had formed deep bonds with his Senali family and friends and found Rutanian formality and tradition stifling.\n\nKing Frane, determined to see his son return and fulfill his royal duties, refused to accept Leed's wishes. The situation threatened to reignite hostilities between Rutan and Senali, as some on both worlds viewed the crisis as evidence that the exchange program had failed.\n\nThe Galactic Republic, concerned about potential conflict in the region, dispatched Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi to mediate the dispute. The Jedi worked with both governments and with Prince Leed to find a resolution that would satisfy all parties.\n\nThrough the Jedi's mediation, a solution was reached. Prince Leed's younger brother, Prince Taroon, who had not been part of the exchange program and had been raised traditionally on Rutan, agreed to become the heir to the throne. This arrangement allowed Leed to remain on Senali while ensuring Rutan would have a suitable successor. King Frane, initially resistant, eventually accepted this compromise.\n\nThe resolution of the crisis not only prevented war but also strengthened the peace between Rutan and Senali. The exchange program continued, though with modifications based on lessons learned from the Leed situation. Both worlds worked to ensure that exchanged children maintained connections with their birth families while also fully experiencing life on the other world.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Rutan remained loyal to the Galactic Republic, though its remote location spared it from major involvement in the conflict. The planet continued to maintain its peace with Senali, with both worlds cooperating on matters of mutual interest.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Rutan came under Imperial authority. The Empire maintained only minimal oversight of the planet due to its remote location and limited strategic value. The Rutanian monarchy continued to govern under Imperial supervision, though with reduced autonomy compared to the Republic era.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Rutan remained under nominal Imperial control, though its isolation from major conflict zones meant it saw little direct involvement in the fighting. The peace between Rutan and Senali endured throughout this period, with both worlds focused on maintaining stability rather than engaging in old rivalries.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Rutan's status became uncertain as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for influence throughout the Outer Rim territories. The planet's leaders work to preserve the hard-won peace with Senali."

The homeworld of the Twi'lek species, Ryloth presents one of the most extreme environments in known space, with one hemisphere perpetually facing its sun in scorching heat while the other remains frozen in eternal darkness. Only the narrow temperate band between these extremes, known as the ""twilight zone,"" is habitable.\n\nThe Twi'leks are a humanoid species characterized by their distinctive head-tails called lekku, which serve both as sensory organs and as a means of subtle communication. Twi'lek society is organized into clans, with their culture emphasizing survival, adaptability, and pragmatism - traits developed through millennia of living on one of the galaxy's most challenging worlds.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Ryloth was discovered by Republic explorers. The planet quickly became known throughout the galaxy for two primary exports: ryll, a valuable spice with medicinal and recreational applications, and Twi'lek slaves, particularly females prized by wealthy collectors and crime lords. This tragic trade in sentient beings has cast a dark shadow over Ryloth's history.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Ryloth maintained membership in the Galactic Republic while retaining considerable autonomy. The planet's isolation meant that Republic influence remained limited, with the Twi'lek clans largely governing themselves according to traditional customs.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Ryloth became a major battleground when the Confederacy of Independent Systems invaded and occupied the planet. The Separatists, led by Techno Union Foreman Wat Tambor, subjugated the Twi'lek population and stripped the planet of its resources. The Twi'lek resistance, led by freedom fighter Cham Syndulla, fought a guerrilla campaign against the Separatist occupiers.\n\nThe Galactic Republic launched a major campaign to liberate Ryloth, with Jedi Generals Mace Windu, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker leading Republic forces. Cham Syndulla's resistance forces proved crucial to the Republic's success, coordinating their attacks with Republic forces and providing vital intelligence about Separatist positions.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Ryloth came under Imperial occupation. The Empire reimposed harsh taxation, conscripted Twi'leks into forced labor, and turned a blind eye to the renewed slave trade. Cham Syndulla reformed his resistance movement to oppose Imperial occupation, conducting guerrilla operations against Imperial forces throughout the Galactic Civil War.\n\nCham Syndulla's daughter, Hera Syndulla, left Ryloth to join the wider Rebel Alliance, becoming a skilled pilot and one of the Alliance's most capable operatives. While Cham focused exclusively on liberating Ryloth, Hera recognized that true freedom for her homeworld required the defeat of the Empire across the entire galaxy.\n\nThe Rebel Alliance occasionally provided support to the Free Ryloth movement, supplying weapons and intelligence. These collaborations demonstrated the interconnected nature of the struggle against the Empire, with local resistance movements and the broader Rebellion working in concert.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Imperial control over Ryloth weakened as garrison forces were recalled. The Free Ryloth movement intensified its operations, seizing control of several cities. The New Republic worked to establish diplomatic relations with the Free Ryloth movement, making the planet's liberation a priority.\n\nThroughout this tumultuous period, the Twi'lek people demonstrated remarkable resilience and determination, maintaining their cultural identity and never stopping fighting for their freedom."

915602,Old, "Saleucami is a world in the Outer Rim. A temperate, arid world with a variety of environments, it is a major trading center for the outer reaches of the galaxy. Due to its takeover by the Techno Union thirteen years before the Clone Wars, it had no choice in being recognised as part of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and was the site of many battles between the Separatists and the Republic. Under the Galactic Empire, Saleucami served much the same role as an economic powerhouse."
915602,New, "Saleucami is a temperate, volcanic world located in the Outer Rim Territories along the Ootmian Pabol hyperspace route. The planet's surface features a diverse landscape of volcanic calderas, geothermal vents, lush river valleys, and expansive plains dotted with hot springs. Despite its volcanic nature, much of Saleucami supports life, with fertile regions that have attracted colonization throughout its history.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Saleucami was discovered during the early expansion of the Galactic Republic. The planet remained lightly populated for much of its history, with small farming communities and trading outposts established in the more hospitable regions. Its remote location kept it largely isolated from major galactic conflicts.\n\nApproximately thirteen years before the Clone Wars, the Techno Union, seeking to expand its industrial base and exploit new resources, took control of Saleucami. The corporate entity established manufacturing facilities and resource extraction operations across the planet, pressing much of the local population into service. When the Confederacy of Independent Systems formed, Saleucami found itself automatically aligned with the Separatists due to the Techno Union's membership in the organization.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Saleucami became a contested world of significant strategic importance. The planet's position along the Ootmian Pabol route made it valuable for controlling access to the Outer Rim, while the Techno Union's industrial facilities provided crucial support for the Separatist war effort. Republic forces launched several campaigns to liberate Saleucami from Separatist control.\n\nThe Battle of Saleucami was one of the major engagements of the Clone Wars' final year. Jedi Master Stass Allie led Republic clone troopers in a campaign to secure the planet, fighting through heavy Separatist resistance. The battle saw intense fighting across Saleucami's varied terrain, with Republic forces gradually pushing back Separatist defenders.\n\nDuring the Republic's campaign on Saleucami, several clone troopers discovered that Order 66 had been executed across the galaxy. Commander Cody's forces turned on Jedi General Stass Allie, killing her while she conducted a speeder bike reconnaissance patrol. On another part of the planet, Captain Rex and other members of the 501st Legion experienced malfunction of their inhibitor chips, allowing them to resist Order 66's programming.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Saleucami came under Imperial control. The Empire maintained the industrial infrastructure established by the Techno Union, using the planet's factories to produce military equipment and supplies. However, Imperial oversight was relatively light compared to more strategically vital worlds, allowing Saleucami to maintain some degree of local autonomy.\n\nThe planet became known as a place where former clone troopers could find refuge. Some clones who had deserted or been decommissioned settled on Saleucami, establishing small farms and attempting to build quiet lives away from military service. The remote nature of many settlements and the Empire's limited garrison strength meant these veterans could often live undisturbed.\n\nOne such clone trooper was Cut Lawquane, who had deserted during the Clone Wars and settled on Saleucami with his Twi'lek wife Suu and her children. Cut established a farm and lived as a civilian, demonstrating that clone troopers could find purpose and meaning beyond their military programming. His existence challenged the notion that clones were nothing more than expendable soldiers.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Saleucami remained under Imperial control, though its remote location and limited military significance meant it saw little direct involvement in the larger conflict. The planet continued to serve as an economic center for the Outer Rim, with traders and merchants using it as a waypoint for commerce throughout the region.\n\nThe Empire maintained garrison forces on Saleucami primarily to ensure continued industrial production and to monitor the major trade routes passing through the system. However, the planet's diverse terrain and scattered population centers made complete Imperial control difficult to enforce, particularly in the more remote agricultural regions.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Saleucami's status became uncertain as various corporate factions and the New Republic competed for influence in the Outer Rim territories."

915702,Old, "Savareen is a world in the Outer Rim. Located at one end of the Kessel Run, it was home to a refinery for coaxium, a type of starship fuel. At one point, the criminal organisation Crimson Dawn operated a business on Savareen, and when the natives rebelled, their tongues were removed as punishment."
915702,New, "Savareen is a remote desert planet in the Outer Rim Territories, positioned along the notorious Kessel Run smuggling route. A harsh, arid world of endless sand dunes and scorching temperatures, Savareen remained largely isolated from galactic civilization for much of its history.\n\nThe planet is home to the native Savareen people, a humanoid species who adapted to their challenging environment through moisture farming and trading with passing spacers. Their small settlements maintained a simple existence across the planet's habitable regions.\n\nThousands of years before the Empire's rise, Savareen's location along the Kessel Run made it a waypoint for smugglers transporting spice and contraband from Kessel. The planet's remoteness and lack of government presence attracted those operating outside galactic law.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Savareen remained largely independent with minimal oversight, allowing the Savarians to maintain their traditional way of life. However, criminal organizations eventually recognized the planet's strategic position and established operations there, building facilities to process and refine coaxium, a volatile hypermatter used as starship fuel.\n\nApproximately ten years before the Empire's rise, Crimson Dawn, led by Dryden Vos, established a massive coaxium refinery on Savareen's surface. The syndicate employed native Savarians as laborers under harsh conditions for minimal wages. When Savarians rebelled against this exploitation, Crimson Dawn's response was brutal - they removed the rebels' tongues as punishment and warning to others.\n\nShortly before the Empire's rise, smugglers including Tobias Beckett and young Han Solo arrived on Savareen with stolen coaxium needing refinement. Their dealings became complicated by the Cloud-Riders, freedom fighters led by Enfys Nest who opposed criminal syndicates and the emerging Empire. Nest revealed to Solo that the coaxium would fuel Imperial military operations, and represented a nascent rebellion gathering resources to fight oppression.\n\nHan Solo chose to help the Cloud-Riders by providing them the refined coaxium, denying it to Crimson Dawn and the Empire. This decision came at personal cost, meaning betrayal of Dryden Vos and losing his chance to reunite with Qi'ra. The coaxium became seed funding for what would grow into a larger resistance movement against the Empire.\n\nDuring the Imperial era, Savareen remained under criminal control, with organizations operating coaxium refineries while the Empire maintained minimal direct presence, ensuring coaxium supply through indirect arrangements. The Savarian population continued laboring under oppressive conditions, their suffering testament to criminal and Imperial exploitation.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Savareen's position along the Kessel Run meant Imperial and Rebel ships occasionally passed through, though the planet saw little direct combat. Criminal organizations maintained careful neutrality, willing to do business with anyone who could pay.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, criminal syndicates competed for control as the Empire collapsed. The native Savarians began organizing more openly against their exploiters, inspired by news of the Empire's defeat and the New Republic's promise of freedom. The coaxium refineries continued operating under increasingly contested control as various factions vied for dominance over this valuable resource along the Kessel Run."

915802,Old, "Scarif is a remote world in the Outer Rim. Once a tropical world used by the Galactic Empire as a secret research center, Scarif was struck by the Death Star and its environment ruined during a raid by Rebellion forces to acquire the plans for that battlestation."
915802,New, "Scarif is a remote tropical planet in the Outer Rim Territories' Abrion sector. Before the Galactic Civil War, it appeared as an idyllic paradise of beautiful beaches, turquoise waters, and palm-covered islands scattered across vast oceans.\n\nFollowing the Empire's rise, Scarif's remote location made it ideal for classified military projects. The Empire established the Scarif Imperial Security Complex, transforming the tropical world into one of the galaxy's most heavily fortified and secretive facilities.\n\nThe Citadel Tower, a massive structure rising from the planet's surface, became the centerpiece of Imperial operations. This imposing installation housed the primary data vault for the Empire's most classified military projects, including complete technical readouts for the Death Star. Director Orson Krennic oversaw much of the battle station's development from Scarif.\n\nThe Empire fortified Scarif with extensive defenses. A planetary shield gate in orbit controlled all access, generating an impenetrable deflector shield encompassing the planet. Shore troopers patrolled beaches and installations, while AT-ACT walkers moved equipment and TIE fighters provided air support.\n\nShortly before the Battle of Yavin, Scarif became the site of one of the most significant battles of the early Galactic Civil War. Rebel intelligence discovered the Death Star plans were stored in the Citadel Tower's data vaults.\n\nA small Rebel team led by Captain Cassian Andor and Jyn Erso launched a desperate mission to steal the plans. This strike team, calling themselves ""Rogue One,"" infiltrated Scarif using a stolen Imperial shuttle. The Rebel Alliance fleet, led by Admiral Raddus, arrived to support them, engaging Imperial Star Destroyers in orbit.\n\nDespite overwhelming odds, Jyn and Cassian successfully transmitted the Death Star plans to the Rebel fleet. However, the entire Rogue One team perished in the battle.\n\nAs the battle reached its climax, Grand Moff Tarkin, observing from the Death Star, ordered a single-reactor ignition of the superlaser targeting Scarif itself to eliminate the Rebel presence.\n\nThe Death Star's superlaser struck the Citadel Tower with devastating force, obliterating the facility and everything nearby. The explosion killed Director Krennic, Jyn Erso, Cassian Andor, and all remaining forces on the surface. The beautiful tropical paradise was instantly transformed into a charred wasteland.\n\nThe blast threw massive debris into the atmosphere, creating a cloud that spread across the planet. Pristine beaches were buried under ash, waters became choked with debris, and vegetation burned away. In orbit, the explosion destroyed the shield gate and numerous vessels. However, the Tantive IV managed to receive the transmitted plans and escaped.\n\nFollowing the battle, the Empire abandoned the devastated world. The tropical ecosystem that had flourished for millennia was obliterated. The Death Star's attack fundamentally altered the planet's climate and geography.\n\nThe Battle of Scarif marked a turning point in the Galactic Civil War. The stolen Death Star plans revealed the battle station's critical weakness, directly leading to the Rebellion's successful attack at the Battle of Yavin.\n\nIn the years following, Scarif stood as a monument to both Imperial cruelty and Rebel sacrifice. After the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Scarif remained abandoned. The New Republic showed little interest in restoration, as the environmental damage was too severe. The planet served primarily as a memorial to Rogue One, who sacrificed everything to give the Rebellion hope."

915902,Old, "Scipio is a frigid world in the Outer Rim. Homeworld to the Muun species, it has been an important center of commerce in the galaxy, being the headquarters of the InterGalactic Banking Clan. During the Clone Wars, Scipio was officially neutral, but leveraged its position to secretly (and not so secretly) aid the Confederacy of Independent Systems with cheap loans."
915902,New, "Scipio is a frigid, mountainous world in the Outer Rim Territories along the Celanon Spur hyperlane. A planet of ice-capped peaks, frozen valleys, and thin atmosphere, Scipio is home to the Muun species and serves as the headquarters of the InterGalactic Banking Clan, making it one of the galaxy's most important financial centers.\n\nThe planet's surface is dominated by towering snow-covered mountain ranges, with settlements built into mountainsides or atop frozen plateaus. The harsh climate makes Scipio inhospitable without environmental gear, though native Muuns evolved to thrive here. Scipio City features elegant architecture with tall spires and domed structures protecting inhabitants from extreme cold.\n\nScipio has served as a major financial hub for thousands of years. The Banking Clan maintained vast vaults and data centers deep within frozen mountains, holding financial records and assets of countless individuals, corporations, and governments throughout known space.\n\nDuring the Republic's final years, tensions grew as Banking Clan leadership, including Chairman San Hill, became sympathetic to the Separatist cause. Though officially neutral when the Clone Wars began, the Banking Clan secretly provided substantial financial backing to Count Dooku and the Confederacy.\n\nApproximately two years into the Clone Wars, Senator Rush Clovis of Scipio became embroiled in corruption scandal involving bribes from the Separatists. Forced to resign, Clovis later claimed evidence of widespread Banking Clan corruption and contacted Senator Padmé Amidala for help exposing it.\n\nPadmé traveled to Scipio with her security detail including Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. The mission became complicated when Separatist forces led by Count Dooku invaded under pretext of protecting the planet from Republic aggression, actually seeking control of the Banking Clan's resources. The Republic responded with clone troopers, leading to the Battle of Scipio.\n\nDuring the battle, Clovis attempted to negotiate with both sides while maintaining Banking Clan control. His efforts failed when Dooku revealed his manipulation. In a confrontation at a mountain facility, Anakin briefly dueled Dooku. As the facility collapsed, Clovis sacrificed himself to save Padmé, falling to his death.\n\nFollowing the battle, the Republic assumed direct control of the Banking Clan. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine placed it under emergency administration, citing corruption prevention. This expanded executive power and gave Palpatine unprecedented control over galactic finances.\n\nFollowing the Empire's rise, Scipio remained under Imperial control. The Banking Clan's traditional independence ended permanently, becoming essentially an Imperial government arm used to manage Imperial finances and exert economic control.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Scipio remained firmly under Imperial control due to its financial importance. The Empire maintained strong garrison forces protecting Banking Clan facilities.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, control of Scipio became a major objective for competing factions. The New Republic and various Imperial warlords recognized that controlling the Banking Clan would be crucial for economic stability and funding military operations. The planet changed hands several times as different factions fought for dominance over this critical financial infrastructure."

916002,Old, "Sirpar is a large planet in the Outer Rim. Its high gravity made it suitable for use as a training center for the Galactic Empire."
916002,New, "Sirpar is a large terrestrial planet located in the Outer Rim Territories. The planet's most distinctive feature is its exceptionally high gravity, approximately 1.8 times the standard gravity of most habitable worlds. This extreme gravitational pull has made Sirpar an inhospitable environment for most species, though the planet maintains a breathable atmosphere and supports limited indigenous life.\n\nThe high gravity of Sirpar has profound effects on anyone spending extended periods on the surface. Physical movement becomes significantly more difficult, with even simple tasks requiring substantially more effort. Prolonged exposure strengthens muscles and bones as the body adapts to the crushing gravitational force, though this adaptation comes at the cost of extreme physical stress. Off-worlders who spend time on Sirpar often experience severe fatigue, joint pain, and cardiovascular strain during their initial period of acclimatization.\n\nDue to these harsh conditions, Sirpar remained largely uninhabited and ignored by galactic civilization for much of its history. The planet attracted minimal colonization attempts, with only the hardiest settlers establishing small outposts in areas where the terrain provided some relief from the relentless gravitational pull. These early colonists developed specialized equipment and architectural designs to help mitigate the effects of the high gravity, though living on Sirpar remained a constant physical challenge.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Sirpar was noted on star charts but considered too inhospitable for significant development. The planet's remote location in the Outer Rim and its extreme environmental conditions meant it received little attention from Core Worlds governments or major corporations.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Sirpar's isolation spared it from involvement in the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet's harsh conditions made it an unlikely target for either side, and it remained largely forgotten as the galaxy descended into war.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Sirpar's unique environmental conditions drew the attention of Imperial military planners. The Empire recognized that the planet's high gravity could serve a valuable purpose in military training. Imperial strategists theorized that soldiers who trained under Sirpar's crushing gravity would develop exceptional strength, endurance, and resilience that would give them significant advantages in normal gravity environments.\n\nThe Empire established a major military training facility on Sirpar's surface, transforming the barren world into one of the most demanding boot camps in the Imperial military. The installation was specifically designed to condition elite soldiers and special forces operatives, subjecting trainees to the planet's punishing gravity while conducting rigorous physical and combat training.\n\nTraining on Sirpar became notorious for its brutality. Recruits sent to the facility faced months of intensive conditioning under nearly twice standard gravity. Every aspect of military training - from basic marching drills to combat exercises - became exponentially more difficult in Sirpar's environment. Many trainees suffered injuries from the extreme physical stress, and some could not complete the program due to the devastating toll the high gravity took on their bodies.\n\nHowever, those who successfully completed training on Sirpar emerged as some of the most physically capable soldiers in the Imperial military. The constant resistance training provided by the high gravity environment developed extraordinary strength and stamina. When these soldiers returned to normal gravity worlds, they found themselves capable of physical feats that would be impossible for troops trained under standard conditions. They could march longer, carry heavier loads, and fight with greater endurance than conventional soldiers.\n\nThe facility also served another purpose for the Empire - as a punishment posting. Officers and soldiers who had fallen out of favor with Imperial command, or who required ""motivation"" to improve their performance, were sometimes assigned to Sirpar. The brutal training environment served as both a corrective measure and a test of loyalty and determination. Those who survived and excelled could redeem themselves in the eyes of Imperial leadership, while those who failed were often transferred to menial positions or discharged from service.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the training facility on Sirpar continued to operate, producing conditioned troops for the Imperial war machine. The Empire maintained strict security around the installation, recognizing its value in creating elite soldiers capable of confronting Rebel Alliance forces. The facility's remote location and harsh environment also made it virtually impossible for the Rebellion to attack, as any assault force would need to contend with both Imperial defenses and the planet's crushing gravity.\n\nDespite its military significance, Sirpar remained largely unknown to the broader galactic public. The Empire classified most information about the training facility, preferring to keep the planet's role in producing elite soldiers secret. This secrecy was maintained both to protect the facility from enemy intelligence gathering and to preserve the mystique surrounding troops who had trained there.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, the Imperial training facility on Sirpar continued operating under the control of Imperial remnant forces. Various warlords and Imperial commanders recognized the value of the installation and competed for control of the planet. The facility's ability to produce superior soldiers made it a valuable asset in the post-Imperial conflicts that erupted across the galaxy.\n\nThe harsh conditions of Sirpar meant that the planet itself remained largely undeveloped beyond the military installation. No significant civilian population emerged on the world, and economic activity remained limited to supporting the training facility. The planet's extreme gravity ensured that it would never become a destination for colonization or commercial development, remaining instead a world devoted entirely to the brutal business of forging elite soldiers through unrelenting physical hardship."

916102,Old, "When this system was under Imperial police authority during the Galactic Civil War, smugglers smuggling illicit goods through this system were literally on the run, in order to avoid being inspected, hence the name ""Smuggler's Run"".\nDue to the Empire's decline, the system is no longer under Imperial police authority."
916102,New, "The Smuggler's Run is a dangerous asteroid field located in the Outer Rim Territories. This vast expanse of tumbling rocks and debris has served as a haven for smugglers, pirates, and criminals seeking to evade authorities for thousands of years.\n\nThe asteroid field's treacherous nature makes navigation extremely hazardous for those unfamiliar with its constantly shifting paths. Asteroids collide regularly, creating new hazards and destroying old safe routes. Only the most skilled pilots or those with detailed navigational data can safely traverse the Run. This danger, combined with the field's remote location, has made it an ideal hiding place for those operating outside galactic law.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Smuggler's Run was already known as a refuge for criminals and outlaws. During the Old Republic era, various pirate gangs and criminal organizations established hidden bases within the larger asteroids, using them as staging points for raids on nearby systems. The Republic's inability to effectively patrol the asteroid field meant these criminal elements operated with near impunity.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, the Smuggler's Run remained a haven for independent operators, with smugglers from both sides of the conflict using it to move contraband and avoid official scrutiny. The Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic both lacked the resources to establish any permanent presence in the field, allowing it to remain effectively ungoverned.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Imperial authorities made several attempts to assert control over the Smuggler's Run and suppress the criminal activity there. The Empire established patrol routes and deployed probe droids to monitor traffic through the field. However, the vast size of the asteroid field and the difficulty of navigation meant that Imperial patrols remained limited and ineffective.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, the Smuggler's Run became even more important to those operating outside Imperial law. Smugglers moving contraband between the Core Worlds and the Outer Rim regularly used routes through the asteroid field to avoid Imperial customs inspections. The name ""Smuggler's Run"" became widely used during this period, as pilots literally ran from Imperial patrols while navigating the dangerous asteroids.\n\nThe criminal organization known as the Glorious Expendable assassins established a base within the Smuggler's Run, using the asteroid field's natural concealment to hide their operations from Imperial authorities. Various other criminal groups maintained similar hidden installations throughout the field, creating a loose network of outlaw havens.\n\nSome of the larger asteroids contained valuable mineral deposits, attracting independent miners willing to brave the field's dangers for potential profit. However, mining operations in the Run were constantly threatened by both the hazardous environment and by pirates who preyed on isolated mining vessels.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Imperial control over the Smuggler's Run effectively ceased. With Imperial forces recalled to defend core territories, the asteroid field returned to its status as an ungoverned frontier region. Various criminal organizations competed for influence within the Run, with no single faction establishing complete control.\n\nThe Smuggler's Run remains one of the galaxy's most notorious locations, a symbol of the criminal underworld and those who operate beyond the reach of governmental authority. Its asteroids continue to shift and collide, ensuring that only the most skilled and desperate continue to brave its dangers."

916202,New, "Stenos is a remote terrestrial world located in the Outer Rim Territories. A harsh planet of rugged terrain and severe weather patterns, Stenos is the homeworld of the Stenax, a winged humanoid species known for their aggressive nature and deeply spiritual culture.\n\nThe Stenax evolved as a warrior culture, with their society organized around tribal structures and religious beliefs centered on death and combat. Their natural ability to fly, combined with their fierce temperament, made them formidable fighters. Stenax culture emphasized honor in battle and viewed death as a sacred transition rather than an end.\n\nFor much of galactic history, Stenos remained isolated from the broader galactic community due to its remote location and the Stenax's aggressive response to outsiders. The species maintained their traditional way of life, engaging in tribal conflicts and religious ceremonies that had remained unchanged for millennia.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Stenax occasionally came into contact with explorers and traders venturing into the Outer Rim. These encounters were typically violent, as the Stenax viewed most offworlders as threats or potential sacrifices for their religious practices. This reputation for hostility ensured that few spacers willingly traveled to Stenos.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Stenos remained largely ungoverned by the Galactic Republic, with the Stenax showing no interest in joining galactic civilization. The planet's isolation and the species' aggressive nature meant that Republic authority never extended to the world in any meaningful way.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Stenos remained outside the conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet's isolation kept it far from the major battles and political maneuvering that engulfed much of the galaxy during this period.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Stenos came under nominal Imperial authority as part of the Empire's claim to control the Outer Rim. However, the Empire showed little interest in the barren world and its hostile inhabitants, maintaining no permanent garrison or administrative presence on the planet.\n\nThe Stenax remained largely unaffected by the change in galactic government, continuing their traditional lifestyle of tribal warfare and religious observance. Imperial surveyors occasionally visited the system but typically avoided landing on Stenos itself due to the aggressive response from the native population.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Stenos remained isolated from the larger conflict between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. The planet's lack of strategic value and its hostile inhabitants meant that neither side showed interest in establishing a presence there. The Stenax continued their existence in relative isolation, maintaining their warrior culture while the galaxy around them descended into war.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Stenos remained an independent world, with the Stenax showing no interest in joining the new galactic government. The planet continued its existence as a remote and dangerous world in the Outer Rim, with its winged inhabitants maintaining their ancient traditions and aggressive defense of their territory against any outsiders who ventured too close."

Home to the Sullustan people, its underground cities form a major trade hub for the entire galaxy, and its native SoroSuub Corporation produces a wide range of goods, from comlinks to starships. During the Clone Wars, Sullust joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. When the Galactic Empire was declared, the SoroSuub Corporation took control of the planet, which angered many locals that formed resistance organisations that allied with the Rebellion. Sullust was the site of the Rebellion's staging point for the attack on the Second Death Star above Endor."
916302,New, "Sullust is a volcanic planet located in the Sullust system of the Outer Rim Territories, positioned along the Rimma Trade Route hyperlane. A tectonically active world, Sullust's surface is dominated by volcanic activity, lava flows, and ash-covered wastelands that make surface habitation impossible. However, beneath this inhospitable exterior lies a thriving civilization.\n\nThe native Sullustans are a humanoid species known for their large, round ears, facial jowls, and exceptional navigational abilities. Rather than attempting to tame their planet's hostile surface, the Sullustans built their civilization underground, constructing vast subterranean cities within massive caverns carved by ancient lava flows. These cities feature advanced environmental systems that filter volcanic gases and maintain comfortable living conditions despite the extreme heat and pressure.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Sullust joined the Galactic Republic and became one of the most important industrial and commercial centers in the Outer Rim. The planet's strategic location along the Rimma Trade Route, combined with Sullustan engineering expertise, made it a hub for interstellar commerce. The SoroSuub Corporation, headquartered on Sullust, grew into one of the galaxy's largest manufacturers, producing everything from civilian goods to military equipment.\n\nSoroSuub's product line included comlinks, food synthesizers, speeders, and even complete starships. The corporation employed a significant portion of Sullust's population and wielded enormous political influence both on the planet and throughout the Outer Rim. For millennia, Sullust enjoyed prosperity through its combination of strategic location, skilled workforce, and corporate success.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Sullust officially joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems, though this decision proved controversial among the Sullustan population. Many Sullustans remained sympathetic to the Republic, creating internal divisions that would persist into the Imperial era. SoroSuub continued its manufacturing operations throughout the conflict, producing equipment for Separatist forces.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, SoroSuub Corporation made a calculated decision to align itself completely with the new regime, effectively seizing control of Sullust's government. The corporation's leadership transformed the planet into a corporate dictatorship, with SoroSuub executives wielding absolute authority. This arrangement suited the Empire, which gained access to SoroSuub's industrial output while avoiding the expense of direct occupation.\n\nUnder SoroSuub's corporate rule, working conditions for ordinary Sullustans deteriorated significantly. The corporation prioritized profits and Imperial contracts over worker welfare, leading to widespread dissatisfaction. Many Sullustans found themselves trapped in exploitative labor arrangements, their freedom curtailed by corporate policies backed by Imperial authority.\n\nThis oppression sparked resistance movements among the Sullustan population. Underground networks formed to oppose both SoroSuub's corporate tyranny and the Empire it served. These resistance cells conducted sabotage operations, spread anti-Imperial propaganda, and worked to undermine corporate control while avoiding direct confrontation with Imperial forces.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Sullust became a center of covert Rebel activity. Many Sullustans secretly supported the Rebel Alliance, providing intelligence, supplies, and technical expertise. Some joined the Rebellion openly, serving as pilots, engineers, and navigators throughout the Alliance fleet. The Sullustan pilot Nien Nunb became one of the Rebellion's most celebrated heroes, serving as Lando Calrissian's co-pilot during the Battle of Endor.\n\nShortly before the Battle of Endor, the Rebel Alliance launched a daring operation to liberate Sullust from Imperial and corporate control. Alliance forces successfully drove SoroSuub's security forces and Imperial garrison from the planet, freeing the Sullustan population. The liberation of Sullust proved strategically vital, as the planet's location and facilities made it ideal for staging the Alliance's most ambitious operation.\n\nThe Rebel Alliance assembled its fleet at Sullust in preparation for the assault on the second Death Star. The planet's underground cities provided secure locations for briefings and final preparations, while its position along the Rimma Trade Route offered convenient access to the Endor system. From Sullust, the Alliance fleet departed for what would become the decisive battle of the Galactic Civil War.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Sullust's fate became uncertain as Imperial warlords seized control of the planet and its industries. Sullust fell under the authority of competing Imperial remnant factions, with SoroSuub Corporation continuing operations under warlord oversight. The Sullustan population endured ongoing instability as various warlords vied for dominance, delaying the restoration of democratic institutions and worker protections. Sullust remained an important industrial and commercial center in the post-Imperial era, with its strategic location and manufacturing capabilities proving valuable to whichever faction held power in the Outer Rim."

916402,Old, "Sump is a humid world in the Outer Rim. Home to the small-brained Nuknog, it is humid, impoverished, and heavily polluted. Nearly a thousand years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Nuknog sold the planet to a mining consortium, unwittingly enslaving themselves. After centuries of this slavery, a pair of Jedi brought news of the deal to the Senate, who required the conglomerate terminate operations and pay back centuries of unpaid wages. This broke the conglomerate, but the damage to Sump had already been done. Galactic interest in the planet faded after relief efforts were conducted, and it remained in unaligned space during the Clone Wars and during the age of the Galactic Empire."
916402,New, "Sump is a humid, swampy world located in the Outer Rim Territories. The homeworld of the Nuknog species, a humanoid race characterized by their small craniums and limited intellectual capacity, Sump is a planet marked by poverty, pollution, and a tragic history of exploitation.\n\nThe Nuknog evolved on Sump's humid surface, adapting to the planet's swampy environment over millennia. Their species developed a simple, agrarian society with limited technological advancement. The Nuknog are known throughout the galaxy for their naivety and trusting nature, traits that would prove devastating to their future.\n\nApproximately one thousand years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Sump's fate took a dark turn when Nuknog tribal leaders were approached by representatives of the Offworld Mining Corporation. The corporation, seeking to exploit Sump's mineral resources, presented the Nuknog with a contract offering payment in exchange for mining rights to their planet.\n\nThe Nuknog leaders, lacking understanding of galactic commerce and legal contracts, accepted what they believed was a generous offer. However, the contract's terms were deliberately exploitative, effectively granting Offworld Mining Corporation complete control over Sump and its resources. The Nuknog had unknowingly sold their entire world and enslaved their species.\n\nOffworld Mining Corporation immediately established extensive mining operations across Sump's surface. The corporation pressed the Nuknog into forced labor, working them in dangerous conditions for minimal compensation. The mining operations devastated Sump's environment, with industrial pollutants poisoning the water and air while strip-mining scarred the landscape.\n\nFor centuries, the Nuknog toiled under corporate exploitation, their health deteriorating from exposure to industrial chemicals and their traditional way of life destroyed by the transformation of their world into a vast mining complex. The corporation maintained strict control over the planet, preventing outside contact and concealing the true nature of their operations from galactic authorities.\n\nApproximately 44 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, two Jedi Knights discovered the situation on Sump during an investigation into Offworld Mining Corporation's business practices. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi uncovered evidence of the fraudulent contract and the corporation's exploitation of the Nuknog people.\n\nThe Jedi brought their findings before the Galactic Senate, presenting evidence of Offworld Mining Corporation's crimes. The Senate ruled that the original contract was invalid due to the Nuknog's lack of understanding and the corporation's deliberate deception. The ruling required Offworld Mining Corporation to immediately cease operations on Sump and pay the Nuknog centuries of back wages at fair galactic rates.\n\nThe massive financial penalty bankrupted Offworld Mining Corporation, forcing it into dissolution. While this brought justice for the Nuknog, it came too late to undo the damage inflicted on their world. Sump's environment had been irreversibly damaged by centuries of unregulated industrial activity. The once-humid swamps were now toxic wastelands, with polluted water sources and contaminated soil making traditional agriculture impossible.\n\nThe Nuknog, freed from corporate slavery but left on a devastated world, struggled to rebuild their society. The Galactic Republic provided humanitarian aid and assistance with environmental remediation efforts, though the scale of the damage meant full restoration would take centuries, if it was even possible.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Sump remained unaligned, too poor and damaged to attract attention from either the Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet continued its slow recovery, with the Nuknog working to reclaim what remained of their traditional lands.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Sump fell into obscurity. The Empire showed no interest in the impoverished, polluted world, maintaining no garrison or administrative presence. The Nuknog were left to manage their own affairs, though their planet's ruined state meant economic opportunities remained severely limited.\n\nMany Nuknog left their homeworld during this period, seeking employment elsewhere in the galaxy. Their species' reputation for being easily manipulated made them targets for exploitation by unscrupulous employers, though some found honest work and built better lives away from their devastated homeworld.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Sump remained isolated from the larger conflict. The planet's lack of strategic or economic value meant neither the Empire nor the Rebel Alliance showed interest in operations there. The Nuknog continued their efforts to restore their world, though progress remained slow.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Sump remained a forgotten world in the Outer Rim. The New Republic provided some additional humanitarian assistance, but the planet's severe environmental damage and poverty meant it remained one of the galaxy's most unfortunate worlds, a monument to corporate greed and the consequences of exploiting less technologically advanced species."

916502,Old, "Syvris is a small moon located in the Outer Rim. Located on the border of Hutt and Imperial space, it was a haven for smugglers, particularly smugglers of spice."
916502,New, "Syvris is a remote moon located in the Outer Rim Territories, positioned along the border between Hutt Space and Imperial-controlled territory. This small, rocky satellite became notorious throughout the criminal underworld as a major hub for smuggling operations, particularly for the illegal spice trade that flowed through the region.\n\nThe moon's strategic location made it valuable to smugglers seeking to avoid both Imperial customs enforcement and Hutt Cartel oversight. Neither power maintained a permanent presence on Syvris, allowing it to operate as a relatively lawless waypoint where contraband could be transferred, stored, and redistributed with minimal interference from galactic authorities.\n\nFor thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Syvris remained largely unknown to the broader galactic community. Its remote location and lack of valuable resources meant it attracted minimal attention from Republic authorities or major corporations. The moon's thin atmosphere and harsh surface conditions made it unsuitable for large-scale colonization, though small outposts and landing facilities were established by independent operators.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Syvris began to develop its reputation as a smuggler's haven. Criminal organizations recognized the moon's advantageous position between competing spheres of influence, establishing hidden facilities where illicit goods could be processed and stored away from the scrutiny of Republic law enforcement. The Hutt Cartel maintained loose influence over the region, though their control remained nominal.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Syvris continued its existence as a criminal waypoint, largely ignored by both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The conflict elsewhere in the galaxy actually increased smuggling traffic through Syvris, as various factions sought black market sources for restricted goods and materials. Spice traders, arms dealers, and other criminals used the moon as a neutral meeting ground.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Syvris's status as a border world between Imperial space and Hutt Space made it even more valuable to smugglers. The Empire's strict customs regulations and harsh penalties for contraband trafficking drove more criminal activity underground, and remote locations like Syvris became essential to smuggling networks throughout the Outer Rim.\n\nThe spice trade became Syvris's primary claim to notoriety during the Imperial era. Various forms of spice - including the valuable glitterstim from Kessel, ryll from Ryloth, and other narcotics from across the galaxy - passed through Syvris's smuggling facilities on their way to markets in both Imperial and Hutt territories. Criminal syndicates established processing centers on the moon where raw spice could be refined before distribution.\n\nThe Empire maintained patrol routes through the region surrounding Syvris, though the moon's location in contested space meant Imperial presence remained inconsistent. Smugglers learned to time their operations around Imperial patrol schedules, using the moon's natural concealment and minimal infrastructure to avoid detection. The Hutt Cartel also showed interest in Syvris's smuggling operations, with various Hutt crime lords seeking to extract tribute from those using the moon.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Syvris became even more important to criminal networks as the conflict disrupted normal trade routes and increased demand for black market goods. Both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance occasionally used smugglers based on Syvris to move sensitive cargo or personnel, though neither side established any permanent presence on the moon itself.\n\nThe moon's criminal community developed a loose code of conduct that allowed various competing organizations to operate in proximity without constant warfare. This uneasy cooperation was essential to maintaining Syvris's usefulness as a neutral ground where deals could be made and disputes resolved without attracting unwanted attention from Imperial or Hutt authorities.\n\nSmuggler captains became familiar figures on Syvris, using the moon as a regular stop on their routes between the Core Worlds and the Outer Rim. The facilities on Syvris, while primitive compared to major spaceports, provided essential services including fuel, repairs, and information about Imperial patrol movements and safe hyperspace routes.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Syvris continued its role as a smuggling hub. The fragmentation of Imperial authority actually increased criminal activity in the region, as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of border territories. Smugglers operating from Syvris adapted to the changing political landscape, conducting business with whoever controlled the surrounding space while maintaining the moon's status as neutral criminal ground.\n\nThe spice trade remained Syvris's primary industry throughout this period, with criminal organizations continuing to use the moon as a key node in their distribution networks. The New Republic's attempts to suppress illegal spice trafficking proved as ineffective as the Empire's had been, unable to establish permanent control over the remote border moon."

916602,Old, "Taanab is a terrestrial world in the Inner Rim. Primarily an agricultural world, it produces the goods that feed much of the Inner Rim and Core Worlds. Originally discovered in the early days of the Galactic Republic, it was not colonised for more than twenty thousand years."
916602,New, "Taanab is a fertile agricultural world located in the Tion Hegemony of the Inner Rim Territories, positioned along the Perlemian Trade Route. A planet of vast plains, rolling hills, and temperate climate, Taanab has served as one of the galaxy's breadbaskets for thousands of years, producing food that feeds countless worlds throughout the Inner Rim and Core.\n\nThe planet's surface features extensive farmlands devoted to growing grain and other staple crops, with scattered settlements and processing facilities that support the agricultural industry. Taanab's economy has been almost entirely focused on food production throughout its recorded history, making it a vital link in galactic food supply chains.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Taanab was discovered during the early expansion of the Galactic Republic. However, despite its favorable conditions for agriculture, the planet remained uncolonized for over twenty thousand years after its initial discovery. The reasons for this lengthy delay remain unclear, though scholars theorize that other agricultural worlds may have satisfied the Republic's food production needs during that period.\n\nWhen colonization finally occurred, Taanab quickly established itself as a major agricultural producer. The planet's fertile soil and favorable climate allowed settlers to establish highly productive farms that could feed populations across multiple star systems. Taanab joined the Galactic Republic and became an important supplier of foodstuffs for the growing galactic civilization.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Taanab maintained steady growth as an agricultural center. The planet's farms expanded to cover vast portions of its surface, with advanced agricultural technology allowing for increasingly efficient food production. Taanab's position along the Perlemian Trade Route ensured easy transport of its products to markets throughout the Core Worlds and Inner Rim.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Taanab remained loyal to the Galactic Republic, continuing to supply food to Republic forces and civilian populations. The planet's agricultural output became even more crucial during wartime, as many other food-producing worlds fell under Separatist control or suffered disruption from the conflict. Republic forces maintained a presence on Taanab to protect its vital farms from Separatist raids.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Taanab came under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the planet's importance as a food producer and maintained oversight to ensure continued agricultural productivity. Imperial regulations imposed strict production quotas, with much of Taanab's output directed toward feeding Imperial military forces and Core World populations.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Taanab remained under Imperial control for most of the conflict. However, the planet gained brief notoriety when the smuggler Lando Calrissian distinguished himself in a skirmish known as the Battle of Taanab. Calrissian, along with several allies, defended Taanab's agricultural facilities from a pirate raid, destroying numerous pirate vessels and earning recognition for his tactical skills and bravery.\n\nThe Battle of Taanab occurred approximately three years after the Battle of Yavin, when a pirate fleet attempted to raid the planet's food stores and processing facilities. Calrissian organized the defense of the planet, coordinating local defense forces and his own ship, the Millennium Falcon, to repel the attackers. His success in this engagement contributed to his later selection as a general in the Rebel Alliance during the assault on the second Death Star.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Taanab joined the new government. The planet continued its traditional role as a major agricultural producer, now supplying food to New Republic forces and civilian populations recovering from years of war. Taanab's farms remained crucial to feeding the galaxy as civilization rebuilt following the Empire's collapse.\n\nThe New Republic worked to modernize Taanab's agricultural infrastructure while maintaining the planet's productive capacity. New farming techniques and equipment were introduced to improve yields while reducing environmental impact, ensuring that Taanab could continue serving as a breadbasket world for generations to come."

916702,Old, "Takodana is a lush, forested world in the Mid Rim. Distant from galactic politics and bordering civilized worlds and the frontiers, it was seen as a haven for smugglers, explorers, and fugitives."
916702,New, "Takodana is a lush, forested world located in the Mid Rim Territories. A planet of dense woodlands, pristine lakes, and verdant meadows, Takodana has remained largely unspoiled by industrialization, maintaining its natural beauty throughout millennia of galactic history.\n\nThe planet's remote location and lack of valuable natural resources meant it attracted minimal attention from major galactic powers throughout most of its history. This isolation, combined with its pleasant climate and scenic landscapes, made Takodana an ideal refuge for those seeking to avoid the scrutiny of galactic authorities.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Takodana was discovered during the early expansion of galactic civilization. However, the planet remained largely uncolonized, with only scattered settlements and trading posts established by independent operators seeking to take advantage of its position along lesser-known hyperspace routes.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Takodana developed a reputation as a haven for smugglers, pirates, and other fringe elements operating outside Republic law. The planet's isolation and the Republic's limited presence in the region meant that criminal activity could flourish with minimal interference from authorities. Various criminal organizations established hideouts and safehouses on Takodana, using the planet as a waypoint for illegal trade.\n\nApproximately one thousand years before the rise of the Empire, a legendary figure known as Maz Kanata established a castle on the shores of one of Takodana's lakes. This ancient structure, built from stones quarried from surrounding mountains, became one of the galaxy's most famous watering holes for smugglers, pirates, and travelers from all walks of life.\n\nMaz Kanata, a Force-sensitive being who lived for over a thousand years, maintained her castle as neutral ground where anyone could find refuge regardless of their allegiances or past deeds. The castle became renowned throughout the criminal underworld as a place where deals could be made, information exchanged, and sanctuary found, all under Maz's protection and her strict rules against violence within her establishment.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Takodana maintained its traditional neutrality. The planet's isolation kept it far from the major battles between the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, though Maz's castle continued to host visitors from both sides of the conflict. Smugglers and information brokers used Takodana as a meeting ground, conducting business away from the war's front lines.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Takodana remained outside direct Imperial control. The Empire showed limited interest in the remote world, though Imperial intelligence agencies were certainly aware of the criminal activity centered around Maz's castle. However, the Empire generally tolerated the establishment, recognizing that completely neutral venues where information could flow freely sometimes served their purposes.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Takodana became an even more important location for the galaxy's underworld. Maz's castle hosted smugglers, bounty hunters, and operatives from various factions, including both the Rebel Alliance and the Empire. The establishment's reputation for neutrality meant that beings from opposing sides could occupy the same space without immediate conflict, though tensions occasionally ran high.\n\nMaz Kanata herself maintained strict rules within her castle. No fighting was permitted within its walls, and those who violated this rule faced permanent banishment or worse. This enforcement of peace, combined with Maz's legendary wisdom and her extensive network of contacts throughout the galaxy, made her castle an invaluable resource for those seeking information, passage, or simply a safe place to rest.\n\nThe castle's architecture reflected its long history, with ancient stones forming walls that had stood for centuries. The interior featured a great hall where guests gathered, multiple levels connected by stone staircases, and numerous private chambers where deals could be conducted away from prying eyes. The castle's position overlooking a lake provided both scenic beauty and tactical advantages, with clear sightlines across the surrounding terrain.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Takodana continued its existence as a haven for the galaxy's fringe elements. Maz's castle remained neutral ground, hosting visitors regardless of their allegiances in the ongoing conflicts between the New Republic and various Imperial remnant factions.\n\nThe planet's forests and lakes remained pristine, largely untouched by the galactic conflicts that had shaped so many other worlds. Takodana stood as a testament to the possibility of maintaining neutrality and natural beauty even in a galaxy frequently torn by war and political upheaval."

916802,Old, "Taris is a terrestrial world in the Outer Rim. Located along the Hydian Way hyperspace route, it was a prosperous trade world that grew into a massive ecumenopolis, a city-world to rival Coruscant. During the Mandalorian Wars, almost four thousand years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, rogue Jedi used Taris as a staging point to combat the invading Mandalorian threat. However, less than a decade later, the world was bombarded by a fleet of Darth Revan's Sith Empire, reducing much of the planet to rubble. Efforts to recolonize the planet began centuries later, but never restored Taris to its former glory. During the Clone Wars it was a member of the Council of Neutral Systems, but was forced to house a Republic fleet to avoid a Separatist incursion."
916802,New, "Taris is a terrestrial world located in the Outer Rim Territories. Once a shining example of galactic civilization and prosperity, Taris developed into a massive ecumenopolis - a planet-wide city rivaling even Coruscant in scale and grandeur. However, the planet's history is marked by catastrophic destruction and failed attempts at recovery.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Taris was a thriving urban world, its surface completely covered by towering skyscrapers, bustling markets, and countless levels of city infrastructure extending deep into the planet's crust. The Upper City housed the wealthy elite in gleaming towers, while the Lower City contained the working class and commercial districts. Far below, in the darkness of the Undercity, the poorest inhabitants struggled to survive among ancient ruins and dangerous mutants called rakghouls - victims of an ancient Sith plague.\n\nApproximately 3,964 years before the rise of the Empire, during the Mandalorian Wars, Taris became a strategic location as the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders swept through the Outer Rim. The planet served as a staging point for forces opposing the invasion, though it avoided major conflict during this period.\n\nHowever, Taris's prosperity came to a devastating end during the Jedi Civil War. Approximately 3,956 years before the Empire's rise, Darth Malak's Sith Empire attacked the planet while searching for the amnesiac former Sith Lord Revan and the Jedi Bastila Shan, who had escaped to Taris after their ship was destroyed. When it became clear his quarry might escape, Malak made the ruthless decision to bombard the entire planet from orbit.\n\nThe orbital bombardment devastated Taris. Billions died as the Upper City was reduced to rubble, with debris raining down on the Lower City and Undercity below. The once-magnificent cityscape was transformed into a wasteland of twisted metal and collapsed structures. The few survivors fled off-world or retreated to the deepest levels, struggling to survive among the ruins.\n\nFor thousands of years following the bombardment, Taris remained largely abandoned. The planet became a monument to the destructive power of the Sith and the terrible cost of their wars. The ruins were left to decay, with only scavengers and the rakghoul plague remaining to haunt the shattered cityscape.\n\nCenturies later, the Galactic Republic launched the Taris Resettlement Initiative, an ambitious project to rebuild the devastated world. Colonists arrived to begin the massive undertaking of clearing debris and constructing new settlements atop the ancient ruins. However, the scale of destruction proved overwhelming, and progress remained painfully slow. The rebuilt settlements never approached the grandeur of the original Taris, instead consisting of modest structures built over the buried remnants of the old city.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Taris had partially recovered but remained a shadow of its former glory. The planet joined the Council of Neutral Systems, attempting to avoid involvement in the conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. However, Taris's strategic location along the Hydian Way meant it could not entirely escape the war. When Separatist forces threatened the region, the Republic pressured Taris into hosting a Republic fleet to prevent a Confederate incursion, compromising its neutrality.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Taris came under Imperial control. The Empire showed limited interest in continuing the rebuilding efforts, viewing the planet as a low priority compared to more strategic worlds. The resettlement efforts stagnated under Imperial rule, with the new settlements struggling to maintain themselves without significant support.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Taris remained under nominal Imperial control, though its lack of strategic importance meant the Empire maintained only a minimal garrison. The planet's inhabitants continued their efforts to rebuild their world, working to clear more ruins and expand their settlements despite limited resources and support.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Taris's status remained uncertain. The planet's long history of destruction and its incomplete recovery meant it held little strategic or economic value to the competing factions. The inhabitants continued their patient work of rebuilding, hoping that one day Taris might reclaim even a fraction of its lost glory, though the ancient ruins beneath their settlements served as a constant reminder of the planet's tragic past and the devastating consequences of galactic conflict."

916902,Old, "Tatooine is a desert world located in the Outer Rim. Populated mostly by moisture farmers, scavengers, and the indigenous Jawas and Tusken Raiders, it has traditionally been located in Hutt space, and was home to Jabba the Hutt until his death shortly before the Battle of Endor. Once, this world was lush and vibrant, until some unknown disaster destroyed most life on Tatooine."
916902,New, "Tatooine is a harsh desert world located in the Arkanis sector of the Outer Rim Territories. A planet of endless sand dunes, rocky canyons, and twin suns that scorch the barren landscape, Tatooine is one of the most inhospitable inhabited worlds in the known galaxy. Despite its harsh conditions, the planet has played a surprisingly significant role in galactic history.\n\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Tatooine was once a lush world covered by oceans and supporting diverse ecosystems. However, some ancient catastrophe - possibly the glassing of the planet by the Rakata Infinite Empire approximately 25,000 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire - transformed it into the desert wasteland it is today. The planet's oceans evaporated, leaving behind vast salt flats and mineral deposits, while its once-verdant surface became endless expanses of sand.\n\nTatooine is home to several native species, including the Jawas - small, hooded scavengers who traverse the desert in massive sandcrawlers, collecting and selling salvaged technology - and the Tusken Raiders, also called Sand People, a nomadic warrior culture that has adapted to the planet's harsh conditions over millennia. The planet also hosts dangerous predators such as krayt dragons and the subterranean carnivorous sarlaccs.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Empire, Tatooine was discovered by galactic civilization and fell under the control of the Hutt Cartel. The Hutts recognized the planet's value as a remote location perfect for criminal activities away from Republic scrutiny. Tatooine became a haven for smugglers, bounty hunters, and various criminal elements operating outside galactic law.\n\nThe planet's economy centered on moisture farming - extracting water from the atmosphere using vaporators - and trading salvage and spare parts. Small settlements like Mos Eisley and Mos Espa served as spaceports where legitimate traders and criminals conducted business in an uneasy coexistence.\n\nApproximately 32 years before the rise of the Empire, Tatooine gained unexpected significance when Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, protecting Queen Padmé Amidala, were forced to land there for repairs. In Mos Espa, they encountered a young slave named Anakin Skywalker, who demonstrated extraordinary Force abilities. After winning the boy's freedom through a podrace, Qui-Gon brought him to the Jedi Order, setting in motion events that would reshape galactic history.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Tatooine maintained its status as a neutral backwater under Hutt control, largely avoiding involvement in the galactic conflict despite its strategic location along several hyperspace routes.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Tatooine remained under Hutt control, with Jabba the Hutt operating his criminal empire from his palace in the Dune Sea. The Empire showed limited interest in directly controlling the desert world, allowing the Hutts to maintain their criminal operations in exchange for cooperation on matters of Imperial interest.\n\nApproximately 19 years before the Battle of Yavin, Obi-Wan Kenobi brought the infant Luke Skywalker to Tatooine, hiding him with Owen and Beru Lars, moisture farmers who were relatives of Anakin Skywalker. Kenobi himself went into exile on Tatooine, living as a hermit in the Jundland Wastes while watching over young Luke from a distance.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Tatooine's isolation made it an unlikely location for major battles, though it witnessed several significant events. Imperial forces searching for stolen Death Star plans tracked the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO to the planet, leading to the destruction of the Lars homestead and Luke Skywalker's departure with Obi-Wan Kenobi to join the Rebel Alliance.\n\nShortly after the Battle of Hoth, Han Solo was frozen in carbonite and delivered to Jabba's palace on Tatooine by the bounty hunter Boba Fett. Princess Leia, disguised as bounty hunter Boushh, infiltrated the palace to rescue Solo, leading to a confrontation at the Great Pit of Carkoon where Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi Knight, defeated Jabba's forces. Jabba himself was killed by Leia, and his criminal empire began to fragment.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Tatooine remained largely unchanged, with various criminal organizations competing to fill the power vacuum left by Jabba's death. The planet continued its existence as a remote desert world where those seeking to avoid galactic authorities could disappear into the endless sands."

917002,Old, "Telos IV, often called Telos, is a world located in the Outer Rim. Located on the Hydian Way hyperlane, it was a critical trade world for the Republic for thousands of years. Discovered shortly after the Great Hyperspace War, it grew prosperous, and served as a military installation during the Mandalorian Wars. However, in the Jedi Civil War, it was bombarded and ravaged by Darth Revan's Sith Empire, and its surface became uninhabitable. After the war, the Republic chose Telos to be the prototype of a project to restore war-ravaged worlds. Despite sabotage by the Czerka Corp, and an attack by the Sith Triumvirate, the project was eventually successful, seeding the world with life from all across the galaxy and restoring Telos to a prosperous beacon for the Republic. In the waning century of the Galactic Republic, famine ravaged the world, leading the governor, Crion, to covertly attempt to conquer a neighbouring world. His son Xanatos, a Jedi Knight, was sent to mediate between the two worlds, but he sided with governor Crion. Xanatos' padawan, Qui-gon Jinn, revealed the plot to the people of Telos, who rose against governor Crion. Following his death at Jinn's hands, Xanatos secretly manipulated the Telosian people into becoming more aggressive and warlike, and exploited the planet's natural resources into desolation. Xanatos committed suicide rather than be arrested. In the Clone Wars, Telos fell within Separatist-controlled space. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, the planet sided with the Rebellion, and was bombarded by Imperial forces, who then committed atrocities against the population."

A world with a complex and tragic history, Telos has experienced cycles of prosperity, devastation, and reconstruction spanning thousands of years.\n\nDiscovered shortly after the Great Hyperspace War approximately 5,000 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Telos quickly developed into an important commercial center. Its strategic location along the Hydian Way made it a crucial waypoint for trade between the Core Worlds and the Outer Rim. The planet's surface featured varied terrain including forests, plains, and urban centers that grew around its thriving spaceports and manufacturing facilities.\n\nDuring the Mandalorian Wars, approximately 3,976 years before the Empire's rise, Telos served as a major military staging area for the Galactic Republic. The planet's shipyards and industrial capacity contributed significantly to the Republic's war effort against the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders.\n\nHowever, Telos's prosperity came to a catastrophic end during the Jedi Civil War. Approximately 3,956 years before the Empire's rise, Darth Malak's Sith Empire bombarded the planet from orbit as punishment for its support of the Republic. The attack devastated Telos's surface, reducing its cities to ruins and rendering much of the world uninhabitable. Billions died in the bombardment, and the once-verdant planet became a scarred wasteland.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Jedi Civil War, the Galactic Republic initiated the Telos Restoration Project, an ambitious undertaking to restore the devastated world and demonstrate that war-ravaged planets could be healed. The Ithorian species, renowned for their ecological expertise, took a leading role in the restoration efforts. Despite sabotage attempts by the Czerka Corporation and an attack by the Sith Triumvirate, the project ultimately succeeded in restoring Telos to habitability.\n\nThe restoration involved importing plant and animal species from across the galaxy, creating new ecosystems on the planet's recovering surface. Massive citadel stations were constructed in orbit to house the population during the restoration process, with these orbital facilities becoming permanent features of Telos's infrastructure.\n\nCenturies later, approximately 44 years before the Empire's rise, Telos faced another crisis when famine struck the planet. Governor Crion, desperate to solve the food shortage, secretly plotted to conquer the neighboring agricultural world of Melida/Daan. When Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn was sent to mediate the dispute, he discovered that his former Padawan, Xanatos, had turned to the dark side and was supporting Governor Crion's schemes.\n\nQui-Gon exposed the plot to the Telosian people, leading to Governor Crion's death. However, Xanatos continued to manipulate Telos from behind the scenes, exploiting the planet's resources through the mining company UniFy and deliberately fostering aggression and militarism among the population. When Qui-Gon returned to Telos years later and exposed Xanatos's crimes, the fallen Jedi committed suicide rather than face capture.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Telos fell within Separatist-controlled space due to its location in the Outer Rim. The planet's industrial capacity made it valuable to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, though it avoided becoming a major battleground during the conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Telos came under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the planet's strategic position along the Hydian Way and its industrial infrastructure, maintaining a garrison to ensure continued productivity and compliance with Imperial regulations.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, elements of Telos's population sympathized with the Rebel Alliance. When evidence of this support reached Imperial authorities, the Empire responded with brutal force. Imperial forces bombarded portions of Telos and committed atrocities against the civilian population, echoing the devastation inflicted by the Sith thousands of years earlier.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Telos began working to rebuild once again from Imperial occupation and the damage inflicted during the Galactic Civil War. The planet's resilient population, having survived multiple cycles of destruction and reconstruction throughout their history, worked to restore their world and secure a place in the new galactic order."

A world of ancient trees, rolling hills, and scattered urban centers, Tepasi has served as an important commercial and industrial hub for thousands of years.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Tepasi was colonized by human settlers during the early expansion era. The planet became one of the founding members of the Galactic Republic, establishing itself as a center of commerce and manufacturing. Tepasi's strategic location along the Perlemian Trade Route ensured steady economic growth and political influence within the Republic Senate.\n\nTepasi is best known as the headquarters of the Tagge Company, one of the galaxy's largest and most powerful megacorporations. Founded by the Tagge family, the corporation grew to encompass mining operations, manufacturing facilities, and commercial interests spanning countless worlds. The TaggeCo Mining Explorer was one of their most successful designs, used throughout the galaxy for prospecting and resource extraction.\n\nThe Tagge family wielded enormous influence on Tepasi and throughout the Core Worlds, with family members frequently serving in the Imperial Senate and holding important governmental positions. Their corporate empire made them one of the wealthiest families in the known galaxy, second only to a handful of other industrial dynasties.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Tepasi remained loyal to the Galactic Republic, with the Tagge Company producing military equipment and supplies for the Grand Army of the Republic. The planet's factories and shipyards contributed significantly to the Republic's war effort, manufacturing everything from personal equipment to starship components.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Tepasi and the Tagge Company aligned themselves with the new government. Baron Orman Tagge, head of the family during this period, recognized the opportunities presented by the Empire's military expansion and secured lucrative contracts for Imperial production.\n\nThe Tagge Company became a major Imperial contractor, producing equipment and supplies for the Imperial military machine. The corporation's mining operations provided raw materials for Imperial shipyards, while their factories manufactured components for everything from stormtrooper armor to Star Destroyer systems. This close relationship with the Empire brought enormous profits to the Tagge family and ensured Tepasi's continued prosperity.\n\nOrman Tagge himself became a prominent figure within the Imperial hierarchy, serving as one of Emperor Palpatine's advisors. His influence within the Empire was such that he frequently competed with other powerful figures like Grand Moff Tarkin for the Emperor's favor and important military contracts.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Tepasi remained firmly under Imperial control due to its strategic importance and the Tagge family's loyalty to the Empire. The planet's industrial facilities continued producing military hardware for Imperial forces throughout the conflict. However, the Tagge Company suffered a significant blow when Baron Orman Tagge was killed during a mission to capture Luke Skywalker shortly after the Battle of Yavin.\n\nFollowing Orman's death, leadership of the Tagge Company passed to other family members who maintained the corporation's Imperial connections. The company continued to operate throughout the Galactic Civil War, adapting its production to meet the Empire's changing needs as the conflict progressed.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, control of Tepasi became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for influence in the Core Worlds. The Tagge Company worked to maintain its business operations regardless of which government controlled the planet, demonstrating the pragmatic approach that had allowed the family to prosper for millennia.\n\nThe corporation diversified its holdings during this uncertain period, investing in various sectors and maintaining relationships with multiple factions to ensure its survival in the post-Imperial era. Tepasi's forests remained largely pristine despite millennia of industrial activity, as the Tagge family had always emphasized sustainable development practices that preserved the planet's natural beauty while extracting its resources."

917202,Old, "Terminus is a bustling trade world in the Outer Rim, resting at the intersection of the Corellian Trade Spine and the Hydian Way trade routes. Due to its proximity to the Unknown Regions and Wild Space, it is not uncommon to see strange and unfamiliar ships in the local starports. An additional result of this unique location is the abundance of pirates and smugglers, who use Terminus as a shadowport."
917202,New, "Terminus is a bustling trade world located in the Outer Rim Territories, positioned at the strategic intersection of two of the galaxy's most important hyperspace routes: the Corellian Trade Spine and the Hydian Way. This convergence of major trade lanes has made Terminus one of the most significant commercial hubs in the Outer Rim for thousands of years.\n\nThe planet's surface features varied terrain including plains, forests, and sprawling urban centers that developed around massive spaceports and commercial districts. Terminus's economy has been intrinsically tied to interstellar trade since its founding, with merchants, shipping companies, and traders from across the galaxy conducting business through its facilities.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Terminus was discovered during the expansion of the Galactic Republic. Recognizing the strategic value of the intersection between the Corellian Trade Spine and Hydian Way, colonists established settlements that quickly grew into thriving commercial centers. The planet joined the Republic and became a vital link in galactic commerce.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Terminus maintained steady growth as a trade hub, with goods flowing through its spaceports from the Core Worlds, Mid Rim, and Outer Rim. The planet's position made it an essential waypoint for vessels traveling between different regions of the galaxy. Major shipping corporations established regional headquarters on Terminus, recognizing its value for coordinating trade operations.\n\nTerminus's proximity to Wild Space and the Unknown Regions gave the planet additional character beyond typical trade worlds. Explorers, scouts, and adventurers used Terminus as a launching point for expeditions into uncharted space, while traders specializing in exotic goods from the galactic frontier made the planet their base of operations. This connection to the unknown regions attracted a diverse and sometimes dangerous population.\n\nThe criminal underworld also recognized Terminus's value. Smugglers and pirates used the planet as a shadowport, conducting illegal business alongside legitimate commerce. The constant flow of ships and cargo through Terminus's spaceports made it relatively easy for criminal elements to operate, as overwhelmed customs officials struggled to inspect every vessel passing through the system.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Terminus remained under Republic control, continuing to serve as a vital trade hub despite the surrounding conflict. The planet's strategic location meant increased military traffic, as Republic forces used Terminus as a logistics point for operations in the Outer Rim. However, the war disrupted some traditional trade routes, causing economic challenges for merchants based on the planet.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Terminus came under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the planet's commercial importance and established a significant garrison to maintain order and monitor trade. Imperial customs officials implemented strict regulations on cargo passing through the system, attempting to suppress smuggling and illegal trade that had flourished under more lenient Republic oversight.\n\nDespite increased Imperial presence, Terminus's criminal underworld adapted and continued operations. The sheer volume of legitimate trade made it impossible for Imperial authorities to completely eliminate smuggling, and corrupt officials could be bribed to overlook contraband. The planet's shadowports continued functioning, now with additional risk and cost built into illegal operations.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Terminus remained under Imperial control for most of the conflict, though the planet's population included Rebel sympathizers and agents who used the busy trade hub to move supplies and personnel. The constant traffic through Terminus's spaceports provided cover for Rebel operations, though Imperial Intelligence worked actively to identify and capture Alliance operatives.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, control of Terminus became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for this strategic trade hub. The planet's economic importance ensured it remained a prize worth fighting for as the galaxy entered a new era of conflict and political reorganization.\n\nTerminus's spaceports continued operating throughout these upheavals, with merchants and traders adapting to whoever controlled the planet while maintaining their commercial operations. The criminal underworld similarly adjusted to changing political circumstances, demonstrating the resilient nature of Terminus's diverse economy."

917302,Old, "Teth is a remote jungle world located in Wild Space. Once the home of a monastery of B'omarr monks, it was eventually seized by the Hutts and turned into a vacation and smuggling world. Eventually the Republic cracked down on the smugglers, and the world declined. During the Clone Wars, Separatist forces held the kidnapped son of Jabba the Hutt on this world, but Republic forces rescued the child. In the age of the Empire, Teth was home to a naval base and small shipyard."
917302,New, "Teth is a remote jungle world located in Wild Space within the Outer Rim Territories. A planet of dense tropical forests, steep mountain ranges, and humid climate, Teth remained largely isolated from galactic civilization for much of its history.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Teth was discovered by the B'omarr Order, an ancient monastic sect devoted to contemplation and the pursuit of enlightenment through the separation of mind from body. The B'omarr monks constructed a massive monastery complex atop one of Teth's highest mountain peaks, where they practiced their rituals in isolation from the rest of the galaxy.\n\nThe B'omarr monastery featured distinctive architecture with multiple towers, courtyards, and chambers designed to facilitate the Order's meditation practices. For centuries, the monks maintained their isolated existence on Teth, welcoming few visitors and having minimal contact with the broader galactic community.\n\nEventually, the Hutt Cartel took interest in Teth's remote location and the existing infrastructure of the B'omarr monastery. Hutt crime lords seized control of the complex, forcibly evicting or subjugating the monks while converting portions of the monastery into a palace and smuggling base. The Hutts recognized that Teth's isolation made it ideal for conducting illegal activities away from the scrutiny of Republic authorities.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Teth served as a vacation retreat for wealthy Hutts and a hub for smuggling operations. The remote jungle world allowed the Hutts to store contraband and conduct business transactions that would have been impossible on more heavily monitored worlds. However, the Galactic Republic eventually cracked down on the smuggling networks operating from Teth, disrupting Hutt operations and causing the planet to decline in importance.\n\nApproximately 22 years before the rise of the Empire, during the Clone Wars, Teth became the site of a significant battle when the Confederacy of Independent Systems kidnapped Rotta, the infant son of Jabba the Hutt. The Separatists, hoping to frame the Jedi for the kidnapping and turn the Hutts against the Republic, held the child in the former B'omarr monastery on Teth.\n\nJedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano led a Republic assault on Teth to rescue Rotta. The battle saw intense fighting as clone troopers scaled the sheer cliffs leading to the monastery while facing heavy fire from Separatist battle droids. Skywalker and Tano successfully infiltrated the monastery and rescued the Hutt infant, though the mission nearly ended in disaster when Separatist forces under Count Dooku's apprentice Asajj Ventress pursued them.\n\nThe successful rescue of Rotta helped secure Hutt neutrality during the Clone Wars and demonstrated the Republic's commitment to protecting even the children of criminal overlords when political necessity demanded it. The battle also proved significant in Ahsoka Tano's development as a Jedi, as she played a crucial role in protecting Rotta during the escape from Teth.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Teth came under Imperial control. The Empire recognized the planet's strategic value as a remote outpost and established a naval base and small shipyard on the world. These facilities allowed the Empire to maintain a presence in Wild Space and project power into regions beyond the normal boundaries of Imperial control.\n\nThe Imperial naval base on Teth remained relatively modest compared to major military installations in more developed regions, but it served important functions in patrolling Wild Space and monitoring potential threats from the Unknown Regions. The shipyard primarily handled repairs and maintenance for vessels operating in the remote territories, though it could also produce small craft when necessary.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Teth remained under Imperial control throughout most of the conflict. The planet's remote location kept it far from major battles between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, though Imperial forces stationed there occasionally conducted operations against smugglers and pirates operating in Wild Space.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Teth's status became uncertain as Imperial remnant forces maintained control of the naval base while the New Republic focused on securing more strategically important systems. The planet continued its existence as a remote outpost on the edge of known space, with the ancient B'omarr monastery still standing as a monument to the various powers that had claimed Teth throughout its long history."

917502,New, "Thrago is a small, barren moon located in the Thrago system of the Unknown Regions. Little more than a ten-kilometer hunk of rock, its surface is covered in a thick layer of dust that obscures its craters, giving it an almost featureless appearance when viewed from orbit. The moon's harsh environment and remote location have kept it largely isolated from galactic civilization throughout most of recorded history.\n\nFor thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Thrago remained virtually unknown to the broader galactic community. Its position deep within the Unknown Regions, combined with the navigational challenges posed by the unpredictable hyperspace routes in that area of space, meant that few explorers ventured near the moon. Those who did found little of interest on the lifeless rock.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Thrago appeared on only the most comprehensive star charts, typically noted simply as an unremarkable satellite with no strategic or economic value. The Republic maintained no presence in the system, and the moon attracted no colonization attempts due to its complete lack of atmosphere, water, or mineral resources worth the expense of extraction.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Thrago's isolation kept it far from the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Neither side showed any interest in the remote moon, and it remained as forgotten and untouched as it had been for millennia.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Thrago's status remained unchanged. The Empire, despite its vast territorial claims and extensive exploration programs, found nothing of value on the dusty moon. Imperial scouts who surveyed the Thrago system noted the moon's existence but recommended no further investigation or development.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Thrago remained an insignificant speck in the vast expanse of the Unknown Regions. Neither the Empire nor the Rebel Alliance established any presence on the moon, and it continued its existence as an isolated, lifeless satellite far from the centers of galactic power and conflict.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Thrago remained as obscure as ever. Imperial remnant forces in the Unknown Regions occasionally passed through the Thrago system, but the moon itself warranted no special attention. It stood as a reminder that even in a galaxy teeming with life and conflict, there remained countless worlds and moons that existed in quiet isolation, untouched by the grand events that shaped civilizations across the stars."

917602,Old, "Thyferra is a hot, humid world in the Inner Rim. It is widely known as the primary source of bacta for the galaxy. Because of this, it has been contested in many conflicts since its discovery four thousand years before the rise of the Galactic Empire."
917602,New, "Thyferra is a hot, humid world located in the Jaso sector of the Inner Rim Territories, positioned along the Rimma Trade Route. A planet of steaming jungles, rainbow-colored flora, and oppressive heat, Thyferra is renowned throughout the galaxy as the primary source of bacta, the most effective healing substance known to galactic civilization.\n\nThe planet's surface is covered almost entirely by dense tropical rainforests featuring xoorzi trees with their distinctive rainbow-hued bark. These forests create a perpetually humid environment with temperatures that make the world uncomfortable for most species. However, this climate is ideal for the two native sentient species: the Vratix, an insectoid race standing over two meters tall, and the Zaltin, a smaller humanoid species.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Thyferra was discovered when Republic explorers encountered the Vratix civilization. The Vratix had already developed a sophisticated understanding of chemistry and medicine, having created alazhi, a bacterial medicine with remarkable healing properties. When combined with kavam, another native organism, alazhi could be refined into bacta, a miracle healing fluid capable of treating injuries and diseases that would otherwise be fatal.\n\nThe discovery of bacta's properties transformed Thyferra into one of the most strategically important worlds in the galaxy. Control of bacta production meant control over a substance essential to every hospital, military, and medical facility across known space. Two major corporations came to dominate Thyferra's bacta industry: Zaltin Corporation, controlled by human colonists, and Xucphra Corporation, a joint venture between humans and Vratix.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Thyferra maintained membership in the Galactic Republic while the two corporations competed for market dominance. The Vratix, despite being the planet's native species and the original developers of bacta, found themselves marginalized by human corporate interests. Most Vratix worked as laborers in bacta refineries, receiving minimal compensation while human executives controlled the profits.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Thyferra remained loyal to the Republic, recognizing that bacta was essential for treating wounded clone troopers and Jedi. The planet's strategic importance meant both the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems sought to secure its bacta supplies, though Thyferra successfully maintained its Republic allegiance throughout the conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Thyferra came under Imperial control. The Empire recognized bacta's strategic value and moved quickly to secure the planet and its production facilities. Imperial forces established a garrison to protect Thyferra from any potential threats, while Imperial oversight ensured bacta supplies flowed primarily to Imperial military and Core World markets.\n\nThe Empire's occupation brought increased exploitation of the Vratix population. Imperial authorities supported the human-controlled corporations in maintaining their dominance over bacta production, with Vratix workers facing even worse conditions under Imperial rule. The corporations paid substantial taxes and tribute to the Empire in exchange for continued control over their operations.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Thyferra remained firmly under Imperial control due to its critical importance. The Empire maintained a strong garrison and closely monitored all bacta exports to prevent supplies from reaching the Rebel Alliance. However, some bacta reached the Rebellion through black market channels and sympathetic smugglers, though at enormous cost.\n\nThe Rebel Alliance recognized that gaining access to bacta was essential for treating wounded personnel. Various covert operations attempted to secure bacta supplies from Thyferra or intercept shipments, though these efforts met with limited success given the Empire's heavy security around all bacta-related operations.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, control of Thyferra became a major strategic objective for both the New Republic and various Imperial remnant factions. The planet's bacta production remained essential for treating casualties in the ongoing conflicts that followed the Empire's collapse.\n\nInitially, Ysanne Isard, former Director of Imperial Intelligence, seized control of Thyferra by manipulating the corporate leadership and establishing herself as the planet's de facto ruler. Isard recognized that controlling the galaxy's bacta supply gave her enormous leverage over both the New Republic and competing Imperial factions.\n\nApproximately four years after the Battle of Endor, Rogue Squadron, led by Wedge Antilles, launched an operation to liberate Thyferra from Isard's control. The battle saw intense fighting both in space and on the planet's surface, with Rogue Squadron ultimately succeeding in defeating Isard's forces and freeing Thyferra.\n\nFollowing liberation, the New Republic worked to reform Thyferra's bacta industry, attempting to end the exploitation of the Vratix and ensure fair distribution of bacta throughout the galaxy. However, the powerful corporate interests, strained resources, and a complex political climate made meaningful reform difficult, and thus Thyferra remained a contested prize in the post-Imperial era."

With a varied population that was more than forty percent nonhuman, it is widely known for its massive bazaars and markets. During the Clone Wars it was conquered by the Confederacy in order to take control of critical supply lines that ran through the system, but a campaign by the Republic led to Tirahn being liberated decisively. The Empire maintained a light presence on Tirahnn, occasionally sending delegations to visit the sitting governor."

Tirahnn's economy has been intrinsically tied to interstellar trade since ancient times, with merchants and traders from across the galaxy conducting business through its extensive bazaars and marketplaces.\n\nTirahnn's population was remarkably diverse, with over forty percent consisting of non-human species from throughout the galaxy. This cosmopolitan character made Tirahnn one of the Inner Rim's most culturally varied worlds, with representatives from countless species living and working together in relative harmony. The planet's markets became famous for offering goods and services catering to virtually any species' needs.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Tirahnn joined the Galactic Republic and became an established member of galactic civilization. The planet's strategic location along the Perlemian Trade Route ensured steady economic growth and made it valuable for coordinating trade operations throughout the Inner Rim.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Tirahnn maintained its role as a commercial center, with goods flowing through its spaceports from across the galaxy. Major shipping corporations and trading companies established regional offices on Tirahnn, recognizing its value as a nexus for Inner Rim commerce. The planet's government maintained close relationships with various merchant guilds and trade organizations.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Tirahnn's strategic importance made it a target for both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet's position along the Perlemian Trade Route meant that controlling Tirahnn would provide significant advantages in moving troops and supplies throughout the Inner Rim.\n\nThe Confederacy of Independent Systems successfully invaded and occupied Tirahnn during the conflict, recognizing that control of the planet would allow them to disrupt Republic supply lines and establish a strong presence along the critical trade route. Separatist forces established military installations on the planet and used its infrastructure to support their operations in the surrounding sectors.\n\nThe Galactic Republic launched a major campaign to liberate Tirahnn from Separatist control. Republic forces, including clone troopers and Jedi commanders, fought to retake the planet in what became a significant engagement of the Clone Wars. The Republic's campaign proved successful, driving Separatist forces from Tirahnn and restoring the planet to Republic control.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Tirahnn came under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the planet's commercial importance and strategic position but maintained only a light garrison and administrative presence. Imperial oversight focused primarily on monitoring trade and collecting taxes rather than heavy-handed occupation.\n\nThe Empire occasionally sent delegations to meet with Tirahnn's planetary governor, maintaining diplomatic relations while ensuring the planet remained compliant with Imperial regulations. This relatively hands-off approach allowed Tirahnn to continue its traditional role as a trade hub while avoiding the heavy Imperial presence that characterized more strategically vital worlds.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Tirahnn remained under nominal Imperial control, though the planet's diverse population included many who sympathized with the Rebel Alliance. The constant flow of traders and travelers through Tirahnn's spaceports provided cover for Rebel agents and smugglers moving supplies and personnel, though Imperial Intelligence worked to identify and capture Alliance operatives.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Tirahnn's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of this strategic trade hub. The planet's economic importance and position along the Perlemian Trade Route ensured it remained valuable to all parties as the galaxy entered a new era of political reorganization.\n\nTirahnn's markets and bazaars continued operating throughout these political changes, with merchants adapting to whoever controlled the planet while maintaining their commercial operations. The planet's cosmopolitan character and focus on trade helped it weather the transitions between different governments, though the changing political landscape brought uncertainty to long-term business planning."

917802,Old, "Toydaria is a large, muddy planet located in Hutt space. Once a vassal world to Nal Hutta, Toydaria deliberately maintains a low technological state, favoring traditional villages and the native Toydarians' own wings. During the Clone Wars the world tried to remain neutral, though its king allowed the Republic to use Toydaria as a base to deliver supplies to a besieged Ryloth, and later a military base. Eventually, this king was killed during a fight between Jedi and Separatist and Nightsister assassins."
917802,New, "Toydaria is a temperate planet located in Hutt Space within the Outer Rim Territories. A world of fetid mires, forests of twisted trees, and sickly green skies, Toydaria is the homeworld of the Toydarian species, small winged beings known for their shrewd business sense and resistance to Force manipulation.\n\nThe Toydarians evolved as flying creatures, developing powerful wings that allow them to hover and maneuver through their planet's humid atmosphere. Their society centers around commerce and negotiation, with the species earning a reputation throughout the galaxy as skilled traders and merchants. Toydarians pride themselves on their immunity to Force-based mind tricks, a rare biological trait that makes them valuable business partners in dealings with Force-sensitive beings.\n\nFor thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Toydaria fell under the influence of the Hutt Cartel. The Hutts recognized the Toydarians' commercial acumen and allowed them considerable autonomy in exchange for tribute and cooperation with Hutt business interests. Despite Hutt oversight, Toydaria maintained its own monarchy, with the Toydarian King serving as the planet's ruler and primary representative to outside powers.\n\nToydarian culture emphasizes traditional ways of life, with most of the population living in small villages built among the twisted forests and swamps. The species deliberately maintains a relatively low level of technological development, preferring to rely on their natural flying abilities for transportation rather than developing extensive infrastructure. This traditionalist approach extends to architecture, with Toydarian structures designed to accommodate their aerial lifestyle.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, King Katuunko ruled Toydaria and sought to maintain the planet's neutrality in the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, the king's sympathies gradually shifted toward the Republic after a meeting with Jedi Master Yoda on the moon of Rugosa. During this encounter, Yoda demonstrated the Jedi's commitment to protecting even small, seemingly insignificant worlds from Separatist aggression.\n\nFollowing this meeting, King Katuunko agreed to establish diplomatic relations with the Republic, though he maintained Toydaria's official neutrality. The king's decision to allow the Republic to use Toydaria as a staging point for humanitarian aid to the besieged planet of Ryloth marked a significant shift in the planet's stance. Republic supply ships passed through Toydarian space, using the planet's location to coordinate relief efforts for the suffering Twi'lek population.\n\nThe Separatists, recognizing Toydaria's strategic value and King Katuunko's growing friendship with the Republic, sought to either secure Toydaria as an ally or eliminate it as a potential Republic asset. Count Dooku dispatched agents to Toydaria to negotiate with the king and pressure him into supporting the Confederacy.\n\nKing Katuunko's situation became increasingly dangerous as both sides of the war sought to influence or control Toydaria. During the Clone Wars, the planet was infiltrated by Separatist assassins working alongside Nightsisters from Dathomir. These agents sought to eliminate King Katuunko and install a more Separatist-friendly government.\n\nA confrontation occurred on Toydaria between Jedi Knights and the Separatist assassins, resulting in King Katuunko's death. The circumstances of his assassination demonstrated the danger faced by neutral worlds attempting to maintain independence during the galactic conflict. Following the king's death, Toydaria's political situation became uncertain, though the planet's traditional monarchy continued under new leadership.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Toydaria remained under Hutt influence, with the Empire showing minimal interest in directly controlling the swampy world. The planet's lack of significant military or economic value meant it avoided the heavy Imperial occupation that befell more strategically important systems in Hutt Space.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Toydaria maintained its traditional focus on commerce and trade, with Toydarian merchants continuing to operate throughout the galaxy. Individual Toydarians could be found on numerous worlds, conducting business in various legal and semi-legal enterprises. The species' natural resistance to Force manipulation made them valuable to criminal organizations seeking protection from Jedi influence.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Toydaria remained within Hutt Space, continuing its existence as a relatively isolated world focused on traditional ways of life and commercial activity. The Toydarians maintained their reputation as shrewd traders while preserving their unique culture and aerial lifestyle on their swampy homeworld."

Home to the reptilian and warlike Trandoshans, it joined the Republic around seven thousand years before the rise of the Empire, but it never integrated into galactic culture as deeply as other worlds. During the Jedi Civil War, Trandosha gained slaving rights to the Wookies of its sister world, sparking millennia of conflict between the two planets. In the Clone Wars, many ""independent"" organisations working with the Confederacy were funded by the government of Trandosha, as a way to wage war against Kashyyyk in secret."
917902,New, "Trandosha, also called 'Dosh' or 'Hsskhor', is a harsh, arid world located in the Kashyyyk system of the Mid Rim Territories. The homeworld of the reptilian Trandoshan species, known for their regenerative abilities and predatory nature, Trandosha orbits the same star as Kashyyyk, creating a millennia-long rivalry between the two neighboring species.\n\nThe Trandoshans are a warlike, reptilian species who worship a deity called the Scorekeeper. Their culture centers around hunting and accumulating what they call ""Jagannath points"" through successful hunts and kills, which they believe determines their standing in the afterlife. This cultural emphasis on hunting has made the Trandoshans formidable warriors and trackers, though it has also fostered aggressive tendencies toward other species.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Trandosha joined the Galactic Republic, though the planet never integrated deeply into galactic culture. The Trandoshans maintained their traditional ways, with their warrior culture and religious practices remaining central to their society despite Republic membership.\n\nDuring the Jedi Civil War, approximately four thousand years before the rise of the Empire, Trandosha gained legal slaving rights over the Wookiees of neighboring Kashyyyk. This arrangement, sanctioned by the Republic at the time, sparked a bitter rivalry that would persist for millennia. The Trandoshans viewed Wookiees as prestigious hunting targets, and capturing or killing Wookiees became a significant way to earn Jagannath points in their society.\n\nThe conflict between Trandoshans and Wookiees became deeply ingrained in both cultures. While the Wookiees developed a profound hatred for Trandoshans due to centuries of enslavement and hunting, the Trandoshans saw the powerful Wookiees as worthy prey that could bring them honor and spiritual rewards. This created a cycle of violence and retaliation that the Republic was never able to fully resolve.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Trandosha officially maintained membership in the Galactic Republic. However, the Trandoshan government secretly funded various ""independent"" organizations and mercenary groups working with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. These clandestine operations were designed to wage proxy war against Kashyyyk while maintaining the appearance of Republic loyalty.\n\nTrandoshan slavers and hunters used the chaos of the Clone Wars to intensify their raids on Kashyyyk, capturing Wookiees under the cover of the larger galactic conflict. Some Trandoshans openly served Separatist interests, working as bounty hunters, enforcers, and slavers throughout Separatist space. The famous Trandoshan hunter Bossk gained notoriety during this period, though his career would extend well into the Imperial era.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Trandosha came under Imperial control. The Empire found the Trandoshans' warrior culture and hunting skills useful, employing many as bounty hunters, mercenaries, and enforcers. The Empire also tacitly supported Trandoshan slaving operations against Wookiees, as the enslavement of Kashyyyk's population served Imperial interests.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Trandosha remained under Imperial control, with many Trandoshans serving the Empire in various capacities. Trandoshan bounty hunters became infamous throughout the galaxy for their ruthlessness and tracking abilities. However, some Trandoshans opposed the Empire or worked as independent operators, demonstrating that not all members of the species supported Imperial rule.\n\nThe planet itself remained relatively isolated from major battles during the Galactic Civil War, though individual Trandoshans participated in conflicts throughout the galaxy. Trandosha's economy benefited from the slave trade and from Trandoshans sending credits home from their various mercenary activities across the stars.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Trandosha's status became uncertain. The New Republic worked to end slavery throughout the galaxy, threatening the traditional Trandoshan practice of enslaving Wookiees. The long-standing conflict between Trandosha and Kashyyyk remained unresolved, with centuries of violence and cultural animosity ensuring that tensions between the two neighboring worlds would persist well into the post-Imperial era.\n\nThe Trandoshan culture of hunting and violence, while abhorrent to many species, remained deeply embedded in their society. The worship of the Scorekeeper and the accumulation of Jagannath points continued to drive Trandoshan behavior, ensuring that members of this species would remain active as bounty hunters, mercenaries, and hunters throughout the galaxy regardless of which government held power."

The planet's strategic location ensured steady economic growth and made it valuable for coordinating trade operations throughout the Core Worlds and beyond. Major shipping corporations established regional offices on Trellen, recognizing its importance as a nexus for interstellar commerce.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Trellen maintained its role as a commercial center, with goods flowing through its spaceports from across the galaxy. The planet's government worked closely with various merchant guilds and trade organizations to facilitate the smooth movement of cargo and passengers through the system.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Trellen remained loyal to the Galactic Republic, continuing to serve as a vital logistics hub for both civilian and military traffic. The planet's position along the Hydian Way made it strategically important for Republic supply lines, though its location deep within the Core meant it avoided becoming a major battleground during the conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Trellen came under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the planet's commercial importance and strategic position but maintained relatively light oversight compared to more politically sensitive worlds. Imperial presence focused primarily on monitoring trade, collecting taxes, and ensuring the continued flow of goods through this critical junction point.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Trellen remained under Imperial control throughout most of the conflict. The planet's deep Core location and strong Imperial garrison made it a secure Imperial holding, far from the major battles fought in the Outer Rim and Mid Rim territories. However, the constant flow of travelers through Trellen's spaceports meant that Rebel agents occasionally passed through the system, using the busy trade hub as a waypoint for covert operations.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Trellen's status became contested as the New Republic advanced into the Core Worlds. The planet's strategic position along the Hydian Way made it a valuable prize for both the New Republic and various Imperial remnant factions seeking to control key trade routes. The battle for Trellen was part of the larger campaign to liberate the Core Worlds from Imperial control.\n\nThe New Republic eventually secured Trellen, recognizing the planet's importance for maintaining commerce throughout the Core. Trellen's spaceports and trade facilities continued operating under New Republic oversight, serving as vital links in the reconstruction of galactic trade networks disrupted by years of civil war. The planet's merchants and shipping companies adapted to the new government while maintaining their traditional role as facilitators of interstellar commerce.\n\nTrellen's position at the crossing of the Hydian Way and Trellen Trade Route ensured it remained strategically and economically significant regardless of which government controlled the Core Worlds, making it a permanent fixture in galactic commerce and a symbol of the interconnected nature of galactic civilization."

918102,Old, "Triton is a small, nearly lifeless planet with three moons in the Outer Rim. Beyond its native insectoid Tritonite people, it is largely unremarkable beyond its location as a meeting point between two hyperlanes. During the Clone Wars, it was the site of a siege by the Republic against the Confederacy."
918102,New, "Triton is a small, nearly lifeless planet located in the Outer Rim Territories, positioned at the strategic junction of the Triellus Trade Route and the Salin Corridor hyperlanes. A harsh, arid world with three moons orbiting overhead, Triton's surface features barren rocky terrain with minimal vegetation and extremely limited water resources.\n\nThe planet is home to the Tritonites, an insectoid species that evolved to survive in Triton's harsh conditions. The Tritonites developed a modest civilization centered around their limited resources, building settlements that took advantage of what little water and arable land existed on their world. Despite their challenging environment, the Tritonites proved to be a hardy and resilient people.\n\nFor thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Triton remained a relatively obscure world in the Outer Rim. Its strategic location at the intersection of two hyperspace routes gave it some importance as a waypoint for travelers, though the planet's lack of valuable resources and inhospitable conditions meant it attracted minimal colonization or development beyond what the native Tritonites themselves established.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Triton joined the Galactic Republic and maintained membership for millennia, though its remote location and limited economic significance meant it remained peripheral to Core Worlds politics. The planet served primarily as a refueling stop and minor trade hub for vessels traveling the Triellus Trade Route and Salin Corridor.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Triton's strategic position made it valuable to both the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet became contested territory, with control of Triton potentially allowing either side to monitor and influence traffic along two important hyperspace routes through the Outer Rim.\n\nThe Confederacy of Independent Systems eventually occupied Triton, establishing military installations to control the hyperspace junction. Republic forces recognized the strategic importance of denying the Separatists this position and launched a campaign to liberate the planet.\n\nThe Siege of Triton became a prolonged engagement, with Republic forces including clone troopers working to break through Separatist defenses and reclaim the planet. The battle saw intense fighting both in orbit and on Triton's surface, with the harsh terrain adding additional challenges for both sides. The siege demonstrated the importance of even seemingly insignificant worlds when they occupied strategic positions along vital trade routes.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Triton came under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the planet's value as a hyperspace junction and maintained a garrison to monitor traffic through the system, though the installation remained relatively modest given the planet's otherwise limited importance.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Triton remained under Imperial control for most of the conflict. The planet's position along major trade routes made it useful for monitoring Rebel activity in the region, though its harsh conditions and lack of major population centers meant it never became a major battleground. The Tritonites continued their traditional way of life under Imperial oversight, adapting as they had for millennia to the harsh realities of their homeworld.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Triton's status became uncertain as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of strategic positions in the Outer Rim. The planet's location at the junction of two hyperspace routes ensured it remained valuable regardless of which government controlled the surrounding space, making it a prize worth contesting as different factions sought to establish dominance in the post-Imperial era."

918202,Old, "Tython is a forested, mountainous world located in the Deep Core of the galaxy. Forested and mountainous, it is often contended to be the original homeworld of the Jedi Order, formed tens of thousands of years ago. In ages past it has been visited by multiple spacefaring civilizations, but the ever-shifting hyperlanes of the Deep Core always lead to Tython being abandoned."
918202,New, "Tython is a temperate terrestrial world located in the Deep Core of the galaxy, within the Tython system. A planet of lush forests, rolling plains, towering mountain ranges, and pristine rivers, Tython has been central to the history of the Force and those who study it for tens of thousands of years.\n\nTython is widely regarded as the birthplace of the Jedi Order, though the exact truth of this claim remains obscured by the passage of millennia. What is known is that ancient Force-sensitive beings, drawn by the planet's strong connection to the Force, settled on Tython in the distant past. These early Force users, who would later be called the Je'daii, established a balanced philosophy centered on understanding both the light and dark aspects of the Force.\n\nThe Je'daii built temples and academies across Tython's surface, creating a civilization devoted to the study and mastery of the Force. For thousands of years, they maintained balance on their isolated world, training new generations in the ways of the Force while remaining largely unknown to the broader galaxy. However, this balance eventually shattered when philosophical differences about the nature of the Force led to the Force Wars, a devastating conflict between those who embraced the light and those drawn to the dark.\n\nThe Force Wars transformed Tython, scarring the planet's surface and devastating its civilization. When the conflict finally ended, the survivors reorganized themselves, abandoning the old Je'daii ways and formally establishing the Jedi Order. These early Jedi eventually left Tython, spreading throughout the galaxy and establishing their order on other worlds, including Ossus and eventually Coruscant.\n\nFollowing the Jedi's departure, Tython became lost to galactic civilization for thousands of years. The ever-shifting hyperspace routes of the treacherous Deep Core made the planet nearly impossible to locate, and knowledge of its location faded into legend. Ancient Jedi texts preserved stories of Tython as the birthplace of their order, but few believed the planet could be found again.\n\nApproximately 3,643 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Jedi Order rediscovered Tython. Guided by ancient records and the Force itself, Jedi scouts navigated the dangerous Deep Core and found the legendary world still intact. The ruins of ancient Je'daii temples remained scattered across the planet's surface, weathered by millennia but still radiating with Force energy.\n\nThe Jedi Order, having recently suffered the sacking of their temple on Coruscant by the Sith Empire, chose to establish their new headquarters on Tython. They built a grand Jedi Temple complex, incorporating elements of the ancient Je'daii architecture while creating a center for Jedi training and meditation. For years, Tython served as the heart of the Jedi Order during the Cold War and renewed conflict with the Sith Empire.\n\nDuring this period, Tython faced multiple threats. The planet's strong Force presence attracted various Force-sensitive species and dangerous creatures. The Flesh Raiders, a primitive native species, periodically attacked Jedi settlements. More significantly, agents of the Sith Empire infiltrated Tython, seeking to corrupt Jedi initiates or steal ancient knowledge from the Je'daii ruins.\n\nTython remained a Jedi stronghold for several years until the Temple was eventually abandoned once again. The exact circumstances of this abandonment remain unclear, but when the Jedi Order later centralized on Coruscant, Tython was once more lost to the shifting hyperspace routes of the Deep Core.\n\nFor thousands of years afterward, Tython remained hidden and forgotten, its location known only in fragmentary ancient texts. The planet became mythical even among the Jedi, spoken of in hushed tones as the legendary birthplace of their order but considered impossible to find.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Tython was occasionally referenced in Jedi historical archives, but no serious attempts were made to relocate it. The dangers of Deep Core navigation and the Jedi Temple's establishment on Coruscant meant the order saw little reason to risk expeditions seeking a world that might no longer exist.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Tython remained lost in the Deep Core, its ancient temples and Force-sensitive groves undisturbed by the galactic conflict raging beyond its isolated system.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire and the execution of Order 66, Tython continued its existence in isolation. Emperor Palpatine, despite his vast knowledge of Sith lore and ancient Force locations, showed no interest in seeking Tython. The planet's strong light side presence would have made it anathema to his dark side philosophy.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Tython remained unknown to both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Its location in the Deep Core, combined with the loss of nearly all Jedi knowledge during the Purge, meant the planet was effectively erased from galactic consciousness.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Tython remained lost. Luke Skywalker, working to rebuild the Jedi Order, searched ancient texts and Force visions seeking information about the Jedi's origins, but Tython's location continued to elude him. The planet remained a mystery, waiting in the Deep Core for the day when the Force would guide someone back to the birthplace of the Jedi Order."

918302,Old, "Umbara is a planet in the Expansion Region of the galaxy, cloaked in shadow. It is home to numerous predatory plants and animals, as well as the technologically advanced Umbaran species. Though a steadfast member of the Republic, even through the beginning of the Clone Wars, Umbara seceded and joined the Separatists after the assassination of their senator, and a major campaign was waged to return the planet to the Republic. During the age of the Empire, Umbarans served as Imperial spies, but have retreated to their home in fear of retaliation since the Battle of Endor."
918302,New, "Umbara is a shadowy world located in the Ghost Nebula within the Expansion Region. Known as the ""Shadow World,"" Umbara exists in perpetual twilight due to its position deep within the nebula, where the light of its sun is filtered through layers of interstellar gas and dust. This permanent dim illumination has shaped the evolution of all life on the planet, creating a unique ecosystem of bioluminescent flora and fauna.\n\nThe native Umbaran species evolved to thrive in this lightless environment, developing extraordinary vision capable of seeing in the ultraviolet spectrum and pale skin highly sensitive to even minute changes in light. Their culture emphasizes cunning, manipulation, and technological advancement, traits that have made them both valuable allies and dangerous adversaries throughout galactic history.\n\nThe Umbarans are renowned for their technological prowess, particularly in military hardware. Umbaran weapons and equipment are considered among the most advanced in the galaxy, incorporating unique designs and capabilities that often surpass even Core World technology. Their starfighters, tanks, and infantry weapons demonstrate innovation that has made Umbaran military technology highly sought after throughout the galaxy.\n\nFor thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Umbara maintained membership in the Galactic Republic. Despite their remote location within the Ghost Nebula and their species' reputation for deviousness, the Umbarans proved to be steadfast Republic supporters, contributing both military technology and political influence to galactic affairs.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Umbara initially remained loyal to the Republic, with Senator Mee Deechi representing Umbaran interests in the Galactic Senate. However, Senator Deechi's assassination by fellow Senator Lolo Purs of Rodia created a political crisis that Separatist agents expertly exploited.\n\nFollowing Deechi's death, the charismatic Senator Mors Banae rose to prominence on Umbara, advocating for the planet's secession from the Republic. Banae successfully convinced the Umbaran government to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems, arguing that the Republic had failed to protect their senator and that Umbara's interests would be better served by the Separatists.\n\nUmbara's defection proved strategically significant due to its advanced military technology and its position along vital hyperspace routes. The Republic recognized that allowing such a valuable world to remain in Separatist hands was unacceptable, leading to the launch of a major campaign to retake the planet.\n\nThe Battle of Umbara became one of the most brutal engagements of the Clone Wars. Republic forces, including Jedi Generals Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Pong Krell, led clone troopers in an assault on the heavily fortified Umbaran positions. The campaign proved exceptionally costly, with Republic forces facing Umbaran militia equipped with advanced weapons and vehicles, fighting in the planet's perpetual darkness where the defenders held every advantage.\n\nThe battle saw intense fighting across Umbara's shadowy terrain, with clone troopers struggling against sophisticated Umbaran technology including starfighters with advanced stealth capabilities, hover tanks with devastating firepower, and mobile heavy artillery. The Umbarans' intimate knowledge of their world's lightless environment gave them significant tactical advantages.\n\nThe campaign was further complicated by the treachery of Jedi General Pong Krell, who secretly supported Count Dooku and deliberately sabotaged Republic operations. Krell's betrayal resulted in additional clone casualties and nearly led to disaster before clone troopers discovered his deception and arrested him.\n\nDespite these challenges, Republic forces eventually captured the Umbaran capital and secured the planet's key installations. However, the victory came at tremendous cost, with the 501st Legion and other units suffering severe casualties. The Battle of Umbara became infamous among clone troopers as one of their most difficult campaigns.\n\nFollowing the Republic's victory, Umbara was forcibly reintegrated into the Republic. The Umbaran government was restructured, with pro-Republic officials installed to prevent another secession attempt. Many Umbarans harbored resentment toward the Republic for what they viewed as an occupation of their homeworld.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Umbara came under Imperial control. The Empire recognized the value of Umbaran technology and expertise, particularly in areas of espionage and covert operations. Many Umbarans found employment within Imperial Intelligence, where their natural aptitude for manipulation and their advanced technology made them highly effective operatives.\n\nThe Empire established facilities on Umbara to research and develop advanced military technology based on Umbaran designs. However, the Empire maintained strict oversight of these operations, ensuring that Umbaran technology could not be turned against Imperial interests.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Umbara remained under firm Imperial control. Many Umbarans served the Empire loyally, viewing Imperial rule as preferable to the chaos of the Republic's final years. However, others secretly sympathized with the Rebel Alliance, though few openly declared such allegiances given the risks involved.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Umbara's status became uncertain. Many Umbarans who had served Imperial Intelligence feared retaliation from the New Republic or from those they had wronged while serving the Empire. Significant numbers retreated to their shadowy homeworld, seeking to avoid the consequences of their Imperial service in the uncertain times that followed."

918402,Old, "Uviuy Exen is a terrestrial planet in the Colonies region of the galaxy, located at the intersection of two major hyperlanes. Throughout the history of the old Republic, Uviuy Exen had remained a loyal world, even through the Clone Wars. In the age of the Galactic Empire it served as a fortress world, and has seen many battles between the New Republic and Imperial Remnant forces."
918402,New, "Uviuy Exen is a terrestrial planet located in the Colonies region of the galaxy, positioned at the strategic intersection of the Perlemian Trade Route and the Hydian Way hyperlanes. This convergence of two of the galaxy's most important trade corridors has made Uviuy Exen a vital commercial and military hub for thousands of years.\n\nThe planet's surface features varied terrain including plains, forests, and sprawling urban centers that developed around massive spaceports and military installations. Uviuy Exen's economy has been intrinsically tied to its role as a crossroads world, with goods and military forces flowing through its facilities from across the galaxy.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Uviuy Exen joined the Galactic Republic and became an established member of galactic civilization. The planet's strategic location ensured steady economic growth and made it valuable for coordinating both trade operations and military deployments throughout the Colonies and beyond.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Uviuy Exen maintained its role as both a commercial center and military stronghold. The Republic established significant military facilities on the planet, recognizing that controlling this intersection of major hyperspace routes was essential for projecting power throughout the Colonies region and defending against potential threats.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Uviuy Exen remained staunchly loyal to the Galactic Republic. The planet's strategic position made it invaluable for Republic supply lines and military operations, serving as a major staging point for forces operating throughout the Colonies and adjacent regions. Republic forces used Uviuy Exen's facilities to coordinate operations and maintain control over the vital trade routes passing through the system.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Uviuy Exen's importance only increased. The Empire recognized the planet as a critical fortress world and invested heavily in expanding its military infrastructure. Massive garrison bases, shipyards, and defensive installations transformed Uviuy Exen into one of the most heavily fortified worlds in the Colonies region.\n\nThe Empire maintained substantial forces on Uviuy Exen throughout the Galactic Civil War, using the planet as a command center for operations throughout the surrounding sectors. The convergence of the Perlemian Trade Route and Hydian Way made Uviuy Exen essential for Imperial logistics, allowing rapid deployment of forces to multiple regions of the galaxy.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Uviuy Exen remained firmly under Imperial control for most of the conflict. The planet's powerful defenses and strategic importance meant the Rebel Alliance could not risk a direct assault, though Rebel forces occasionally conducted raids on Imperial convoys passing through the system.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Uviuy Exen became a major objective for both the New Republic and various Imperial remnant factions. The planet's position at the intersection of two major hyperspace routes made it invaluable for controlling access to large portions of the Colonies region and beyond.\n\nThe struggle for control of Uviuy Exen proved lengthy and costly. Imperial forces, recognizing the strategic disaster that losing the planet would represent, defended it with determination. The New Republic, equally aware of its importance, committed substantial resources to capturing the fortress world.\n\nUviuy Exen changed hands multiple times during the conflicts that followed the Battle of Endor. Each faction that controlled the planet used it as a base for operations throughout the Colonies region, with its strategic position allowing for rapid response to threats across multiple sectors. The constant fighting took a toll on the planet's infrastructure and civilian population.\n\nThe battles for Uviuy Exen demonstrated the continuing importance of controlling key hyperspace junctions in the post-Imperial era. Whichever faction held the planet could project power throughout the surrounding regions and control vital trade routes, making Uviuy Exen a prize worth any cost in the struggle to determine the galaxy's future."

Thanks to this, and the dense milky fog covering the whole system, miners and traders disappear with alarming regularity here, though very few dare to get this far from the well-protected sectors.\nThe wreck field tells the story of numerous miners killed during pirate raids, after refusing to cooperate.\nBut there's something that even the pirates are afraid about. An unknown threat, which makes pirate raids less frequent in this sector, than in the past."
918502,New, "The Unknown Regions comprise vast, uncharted territories beyond the Outer Rim. For millennia, these regions remained unexplored due to chaotic hyperspace anomalies, gravitational distortions, and rogue magnetospheres that rendered standard navigation computers useless.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, the Unknown Regions were considered impassable except along a few ancient, closely-guarded hyperspace routes. The Chiss Ascendancy, native to this region, developed alternative navigation methods using Force-sensitive navigators to traverse the unstable pathways.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Empire, the ill-fated Outbound Flight project attempted systematic exploration but was destroyed by unknown forces in the Redoubt cluster. Following this disaster, Republic interest in the Unknown Regions waned.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars and Imperial era, the Unknown Regions remained largely ignored by galactic governments. However, Emperor Palpatine maintained secret exploration programs, seeking ancient Sith artifacts and potential threats. Some Imperial forces retreated into these regions following the Battle of Endor.\n\nPirate groups and desperate smugglers occasionally ventured into fringe systems, seeking undefended targets or valuable salvage. Most never returned. The wreckage fields tell stories of ships that disappeared investigating anomalous readings.\n\nLocal spacers whisper of vessels vanishing without distress calls, of strange energy signatures that disrupt sensors, and of something that even hardened criminals fear to name."

918602,Old, "Not much is known about this system, apart from being located on a pirate-mapped hyperlane, which leads to the 'outermost' known system in the Unknown Regions, dubbed 'Unknown Region 3'."
918602,New, "This system lies along one of the few marginally-stable hyperspace routes mapping deeper into the Unknown Regions. Discovered by pirate scouts seeking sanctuary from Imperial patrols, it serves as a waypoint to more distant territories.\n\nThe system contains no habitable worlds, only a handful of barren rocks orbiting a dim star. Pirates established a small refueling cache here, hidden among asteroid debris, though it sees infrequent use. Navigation through this region remains treacherous, with hyperspace exit coordinates requiring constant recalculation.\n\nFew records exist of what lies beyond this system, as most expeditions fail to return. Those that do report contradictory sensor data and unidentifiable contacts at extreme range. The pirates who originally charted this route have largely abandoned it, citing ""bad omens"" and unexplained losses."

918702,Old, "Star systems and general expeditions in the Unknown Regions are considered uneconomical by most recognised governments. However, pirates and a few nameless privateers look forward to find an undiscovered race to be raided upon, or to make mutually beneficial trade partnerships with, respectively.\nThis system is considered to be one of the 'outermost' systems with pre-calculated Jump Routes leading to it. Formerly frequented by pirates and criminals, it was abandoned because of the extreme dangers of being far from any reinforcements in case of an attack by unspecified parties."
918702,New, "This system represents one of the furthest known points accessible via pre-calculated jump routes. Located deep in the Unknown Regions, it marks the effective boundary of explored space for all but the most desperate or foolhardy.\n\nThe system once attracted interest from criminal organizations seeking remote bases beyond Imperial jurisdiction. Several groups established temporary outposts on the system's outer planetoids, but all were mysteriously abandoned within standard years. Salvage teams found these facilities intact but deserted, with no signs of struggle or explanation for the occupants' departure.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, this system saw occasional use by smugglers running desperate routes to avoid Imperial interdiction. However, an increasing number of vessels reported sensor anomalies, unexplained power fluctuations, and sightings of unidentified craft that matched no known design.\n\nFollowing several high-profile disappearances, even the most hardened spacers began avoiding this region. The few who still venture here do so only in dire circumstances, and never linger longer than necessary for emergency repairs.\n\nAstrographic data remains incomplete. Long-range scans detect numerous star systems beyond this point, but hyperspace routes to them remain uncharted. Some navigation computers refuse to calculate jumps deeper into the Unknown Regions, displaying corruption errors that technicians cannot explain.\n\nWhispered rumors among spacers speak of ancient guardians, of intelligences that do not tolerate intrusion, of technologies that predate known galactic civilization. Most dismiss such talk as spacer superstition. Most, but not all."

918802,Old, "Utapau is a rocky world in the Outer Rim. Home to the Pau'an and Utai species, civilisation on this world is often built into the massive sinkholes that dot the landscape, revealing a subterranean ocean. Utapau was not a member of the Galactic Republic, and remained neutral during the Clone Wars until its occupation by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In the final days of the war, Separatist leaders gathered there, but were nearly captured in a Republic assault. After the rise of the Galactic Empire, Utapau was occupied by Imperial forces."
918802,New, "Utapau is a remote desert world located in the Tarabba sector of the Outer Rim Territories. A planet of endless windswept plains and massive sinkholes that plunge kilometers into the surface, Utapau is home to two native sentient species who built their civilization within these natural chasms to shelter from the harsh surface conditions.\n\nThe Pau'ans are tall, gaunt humanoids with pale gray skin and distinctive facial ridges. They are characterized by their long lifespans, sharp teeth, and preference for darkness due to their photosensitive eyes. The Utai are smaller, stocky humanoids who typically handle manual labor and technical work. Despite their physical differences, both species coexist peacefully in a harmonious society that has endured for millennia.\n\nUtapau's settlements are built within the massive sinkholes, with structures carved into the rock walls extending down through multiple levels. The capital city of Pau City, located in one of the largest sinkholes, exemplifies this architectural style with its tiered construction and landing platforms jutting from the sinkhole walls. These cities provide shelter from the planet's fierce windstorms while allowing access to underground water and resources.\n\nFor thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Utapau remained isolated from galactic politics. The planet never joined the Galactic Republic, preferring to maintain its independence and traditional way of life. This isolation meant Utapau avoided many of the conflicts that engulfed other worlds, though it remained connected to galactic commerce through independent traders.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Utapau initially maintained its neutrality, refusing to join either the Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, approximately 19 years before the rise of the Empire, the Separatists forcibly occupied the planet. General Grievous, Supreme Commander of the Separatist Droid Army, established his headquarters in Pau City, using Utapau as a refuge for the Separatist Council.\n\nThe Separatist occupation proved oppressive for Utapau's inhabitants. Droid armies controlled the planet's settlements, and the Pau'an and Utai population were forced to cooperate with their occupiers. Port Administrator Tion Medon and other local leaders maintained order while secretly hoping for liberation.\n\nWhen the Republic learned of Grievous's location on Utapau, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi was dispatched to capture or eliminate him. Arriving at Pau City under the guise of seeking refueling, Kenobi was secretly informed by Tion Medon of the Separatist presence. This intelligence allowed Kenobi to coordinate a Republic assault on the planet.\n\nThe Battle of Utapau commenced when Republic forces, including clone troopers under Commander Cody, attacked Pau City. Kenobi confronted General Grievous directly, engaging the cyborg general in combat while Republic forces battled battle droids throughout the city. The fighting raged across multiple levels of the sinkhole, with both sides employing ground vehicles and starfighters.\n\nDuring the battle, Kenobi succeeded in killing General Grievous, eliminating one of the Separatists' most dangerous commanders. However, even as Republic victory seemed certain, Chancellor Palpatine executed Order 66, commanding all clone troopers to eliminate their Jedi commanders. Commander Cody attempted to kill Kenobi, but the Jedi Master survived by falling into water at the sinkhole's depths and escaped the planet.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Utapau came under Imperial control. The Empire established a garrison on the planet and maintained oversight of the local population. The Pau'ans and Utai, having endured Separatist occupation, now found themselves under a new authoritarian government, though Imperial presence remained relatively light compared to more strategically important worlds.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Utapau remained under Imperial control throughout most of the conflict. The planet's remote location and limited strategic value meant it saw minimal involvement in the larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Utapau's status became uncertain as various Imperial remnant factions and corporations competed for influence in the Outer Rim territories."

A planet of fertile plains, rolling hills, and productive farmlands, Uyter has served as an important food producer for the surrounding regions for thousands of years.\n\nThe planet's surface features vast agricultural zones devoted to growing crops and raising livestock, with scattered settlements and processing facilities that support the farming industry. Uyter's economy has been almost entirely focused on food production throughout its recorded history, making it a vital link in regional food supply chains.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Uyter joined the Galactic Republic and became an established member of galactic civilization. The planet's agricultural output proved valuable for feeding populations across multiple star systems, and Uyter maintained steady but unremarkable growth as a farming world.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Uyter continued its traditional role as a food producer, with most inhabitants living simple agrarian lives focused on farming and local trade. The planet's government maintained close relationships with various agricultural cooperatives and trading organizations to ensure efficient distribution of its products.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Uyter's importance increased dramatically when many other agricultural worlds seceded to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems. With food supplies disrupted across multiple regions, the Galactic Republic became heavily dependent on worlds like Uyter that remained loyal. The planet received increased trade contracts to help feed both civilian populations and Republic military forces.\n\nThe increased demand placed significant strain on Uyter's agricultural infrastructure, with farmers working extended hours to meet production quotas. Republic authorities provided additional resources and support to help expand farming operations, recognizing that maintaining food supplies was crucial to the war effort. Uyter's farmers took pride in their contribution to sustaining the Republic during this crisis.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Uyter came under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the planet's value as a food producer and maintained oversight to ensure continued agricultural productivity. Imperial regulations imposed strict production quotas, with much of Uyter's output directed toward feeding Imperial military forces and Core World populations.\n\nThe Empire established an Imperial Academy on Uyter, using the agricultural world as a training ground for future officers and administrators. The Academy became a significant presence on the planet, bringing increased military activity to what had traditionally been a peaceful farming world. Many young Uyterans enrolled in the Academy, seeking opportunities for advancement that were otherwise unavailable on their agricultural homeworld.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Uyter remained under Imperial control throughout most of the conflict. The planet's agricultural output continued to support Imperial forces, though some farmers privately sympathized with the Rebel Alliance. The Imperial Academy on Uyter produced officers who served throughout the Imperial military, contributing to the Empire's war effort against the Rebellion.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Uyter's status became contested. The planet's agricultural importance made it valuable to both the New Republic and various Imperial remnant factions seeking to control food supplies. The Imperial Academy's fate remained uncertain as different factions competed for control of the Mid Rim territories.\n\nUyter's farmers continued their traditional work regardless of which government controlled the planet, focused on the perpetual cycle of planting and harvesting that had sustained their world for millennia. The planet remained an essential food producer for whatever faction held power, ensuring that Uyter maintained its importance in the post-Imperial era despite lacking the strategic military significance of other worlds."

The planet's strategic location along the Shwuy Exchange made it valuable for coordinating trade and military logistics during these conflicts.\n\nThroughout the Old Republic era, Vakkar maintained its role as a minor commercial center, with goods and travelers passing through its spaceports from across the Colonies and neighboring sectors. The planet's government worked with various merchant organizations to facilitate trade while preserving local stability. Vakkar's economy remained modest, focused on supporting the needs of passing vessels and regional commerce.\n\nDuring the Imperial era, Vakkar became the sector capital of the Fakir sector. The Empire established administrative offices and a garrison on the planet to oversee regional affairs and maintain order along the Shwuy Exchange. Imperial oversight brought increased regulation to commerce, though Vakkar's economy continued to benefit from its strategic position as a refueling and trade hub.\n\nThe planet avoided major involvement in galactic conflicts, maintaining its traditional role as a waypoint rather than a battleground. Its modest population and limited resources meant it attracted minimal attention from Core Worlds governments or major corporations. Vakkar's inhabitants continued their quiet way of life, focused on supporting trade and maintaining local stability.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Vakkar's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of key positions along the Shwuy Exchange. The planet's economic importance ensured it remained valuable regardless of which government controlled the surrounding space, though it continued to avoid direct involvement in major galactic events."

919102,Old, "Vergesso is an asteroid field located in the Outer Rim. During the age of the Galactic Empire it was home to an Imperial cargo depot, but also a secret Rebel shipyard and regional headquarters built into Vergesso Prime, the largest asteroid in the field. Some time before the death of the Emperor, this shipyard was destroyed by the Star Dreadnaught Executor."
919102,New, "Vergesso is a remote asteroid field located in the Lybeya system of the Outer Rim Territories. The field consists of countless tumbling rocks of varying sizes, creating a treacherous maze of debris that makes navigation extremely hazardous for those unfamiliar with its shifting paths. Only the most skilled pilots or those with detailed navigational data can safely traverse the Vergesso asteroids.\n\nThe largest asteroid in the field, Vergesso Prime, became the site of significant development during the Galactic Civil War. The asteroid's immense size and natural concealment within the field made it ideal for establishing hidden facilities away from Imperial scrutiny.\n\nFor thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Vergesso asteroid field remained largely unexplored and avoided by most spacers. Its remote location in the Outer Rim and dangerous navigation conditions meant few ventured into its depths. However, the field occasionally attracted independent miners seeking valuable minerals hidden within its asteroids.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, the Vergesso system appeared on only the most comprehensive star charts, typically noted simply as an asteroid field with no particular strategic or economic value. The Republic maintained no presence in the system, and the asteroids attracted minimal attention from major corporations or governments.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Vergesso's isolation kept it far from the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Neither side showed interest in the remote asteroid field, and it remained as forgotten and untouched as it had been for millennia.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Vergesso's status changed dramatically. The Empire recognized the asteroid field's potential as a secure location for storing military cargo away from potential Rebel attacks. Imperial forces established a cargo depot facility within the asteroid field, using the natural concealment provided by the tumbling rocks to hide supplies and equipment.\n\nThe Imperial cargo depot served as a logistics hub for Imperial operations in the surrounding Outer Rim sectors. Freighters would rendezvous with the facility to transfer military equipment, supplies, and materiel that would then be distributed to Imperial forces throughout the region. The depot's location within the asteroid field provided excellent security, as approaching vessels required precise navigational data to reach it safely.\n\nHowever, the Rebel Alliance also recognized Vergesso's value as a hidden base location. Secretly, Alliance engineers began construction of a shipyard and regional headquarters facility within Vergesso Prime itself. This massive undertaking involved hollowing out portions of the asteroid's interior and installing sophisticated ship construction and repair facilities.\n\nThe Rebel shipyard at Vergesso Prime became one of the Alliance's most important hidden installations during the Galactic Civil War. Protected by the asteroid field's natural defenses and the need for specialized navigation to reach it, the facility operated in complete secrecy for an extended period. Alliance engineers worked to construct and repair starships far from Imperial detection.\n\nThe existence of both Imperial and Rebel facilities within the same asteroid field created a precarious situation. The two installations operated unknowingly in close proximity, with neither side initially aware of the other's presence. This arrangement could not last indefinitely.\n\nEventually, Imperial Intelligence discovered the existence of the Rebel shipyard hidden within Vergesso Prime. The Empire viewed the facility as a significant threat that required immediate elimination. Rather than deploy a conventional assault force that might struggle with the asteroid field's navigation challenges, the Empire dispatched the Executor, Darth Vader's massive Super Star Destroyer.\n\nThe Executor, one of the most powerful warships ever constructed, entered the Vergesso asteroid field with orders to destroy the Rebel installation. The Super Star Destroyer's immense firepower proved devastating to the hidden Rebel base. Imperial forces launched a massive bombardment of Vergesso Prime, targeting the asteroid's weak points and the locations where Rebel facilities had been constructed.\n\nThe attack resulted in catastrophic damage to Vergesso Prime. The asteroid suffered structural collapse as Imperial fire destroyed the Rebel shipyard and regional headquarters. The facility, which had taken considerable time and resources to construct, was effectively obliterated in the Imperial assault. Rebel personnel who survived the bombardment were forced to evacuate as the asteroid's interior facilities were reduced to rubble.\n\nThe destruction of the Vergesso shipyard represented a significant setback for the Rebel Alliance. The loss of the construction facilities and regional command center disrupted Alliance operations throughout the Outer Rim. Additionally, the attack demonstrated that even hidden bases deep within asteroid fields were not immune to Imperial retaliation once discovered.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Rebel facilities, the Empire maintained its cargo depot within the Vergesso asteroid field, though enhanced security measures were implemented. The depot continued serving Imperial logistics operations throughout the remainder of the Galactic Civil War.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, control of the Vergesso asteroid field became uncertain. Imperial remnant forces likely maintained the cargo depot for a period, using it to support their operations in the Outer Rim. However, as Imperial authority fragmented, the facility's status remained unclear.\n\nThe Vergesso asteroid field remained a dangerous region to navigate regardless of political control. Its natural hazards continued to deter casual exploration, ensuring that only those with specific reasons to enter the field would brave its tumbling rocks and shifting navigation paths. The ruins of the destroyed Rebel shipyard within Vergesso Prime stood as a monument to the risks of hidden warfare and the Empire's determination to eliminate any threat to its dominance."

A world of varied terrain including forests, plains, and scattered urban centers, Vondarc developed as a modest trade hub due to its position along this important hyperspace corridor.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Vondarc joined the Galactic Republic and became an established waypoint for traders and travelers moving through the Outer Rim. The planet's strategic location ensured steady economic activity, though it never achieved the prominence of major trade worlds.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Vondarc maintained its role as a commercial center, with goods flowing through its spaceports from across the galaxy. The planet's government worked with various merchant organizations to facilitate trade while maintaining local stability.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Vondarc fell under the control of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Separatists recognized the planet's value along the Rimma Trade Route and established a presence to monitor traffic and support their operations in the surrounding sectors. Despite Separatist occupation, most inhabitants continued their traditional commercial activities.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Vondarc came under Imperial authority. The Empire established a garrison on the planet to maintain order and protect the vital trade route passing through the system. Imperial oversight brought increased regulation to commerce, though Vondarc's economy continued to benefit from its strategic position.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Vondarc remained under Imperial control for most of the conflict. The planet's location made it strategically valuable to both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, though the Imperial garrison deterred major Rebel operations in the system.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Vondarc's status became contested as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of key positions along the Rimma Trade Route. The planet's economic importance ensured it remained valuable regardless of which government controlled the surrounding space."

919302,Old, "Vortex is a terrestrial world in the Mid Rim, home to the seemingly emotionless Vor species. A member of the Galactic Republic for thousands of years, the center of culture on Vor was the famous Cathedral of Winds, a massive and intricate structure that created music using the planet's strong winds. When the Galactic Empire was established, the Vor declared that no music would be made on the planet, as protest against actions committed by the new government."
919302,New, "Vortex is a temperate terrestrial world located in the Vortex system of the Mid Rim Territories. A planet dominated by vast plains, towering mountain ranges, and perpetually strong winds that sweep across its surface, Vortex is home to the Vors, a humanoid species characterized by their stoic demeanor and deep connection to music and atmospheric phenomena.\n\nThe Vors are a generally emotionless species who evolved to thrive in Vortex's windy environment. Their most distinctive cultural achievement is the Cathedral of Winds, a massive crystalline structure that serves as both a religious temple and a musical instrument. Built over generations from materials that resonate with the planet's constant winds, the Cathedral produces hauntingly beautiful tones as air flows through its countless chambers and passages. The Cathedral represents the pinnacle of Vor culture and spirituality, with the music it creates considered sacred by the species.\n\nVor society places great emphasis on harmony with their planet's natural forces. Their architecture and settlements are designed to work with rather than against the strong winds, creating structures that sing and resonate with the atmospheric currents. The Vors themselves communicate partially through subtle tonal variations that complement their spoken language, making them naturally gifted musicians despite their outwardly stoic appearance.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Vortex joined the Galactic Republic and became a valued member world. The planet's strategic location in the Mid Rim and the Vors' peaceful nature made them reliable allies. Many Vors left their homeworld to serve the Republic in various capacities, particularly in diplomatic and cultural roles where their unique perspective proved valuable.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Vortex remained loyal to the Republic, contributing to the war effort while attempting to maintain their traditional way of life. The planet's isolation from major battle zones meant it avoided direct involvement in most of the conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Vors witnessed the transformation of the Republic they had served into an authoritarian regime. In protest against the Empire's oppressive policies and the destruction of democratic institutions, the Vors made a collective decision to silence the Cathedral of Winds. No music would be created within its halls as long as the Empire ruled the galaxy, making this silence a powerful statement of peaceful resistance.\n\nThis act of cultural defiance symbolized the Vors' rejection of Imperial rule while adhering to their philosophy of non-violence. The Empire, recognizing that forcing the Vors to resume their musical traditions would be counterproductive and potentially spark wider resistance, grudgingly tolerated this act of protest.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Vortex remained under nominal Imperial control, though many Vors sympathized with the Rebel Alliance's fight to restore the Republic. The planet maintained its cultural silence, with the Cathedral of Winds standing as a monument to resistance through the absence of its sacred music.\n\nApproximately twelve years after the Battle of Endor, the New Republic organized a diplomatic conference on Vortex to demonstrate the peaceful coexistence possible under the new government. During this historic event, tragedy struck when the rogue Admiral Ackdool crashed a ship into the Cathedral of Winds, destroying the ancient structure and killing numerous Vors, including many members of the priesthood who maintained the Cathedral.\n\nThe destruction of their most sacred site devastated Vor culture. However, the New Republic's commitment to helping rebuild demonstrated the fundamental difference between the Empire and the restored democratic government. Chief of State Leia Organa Solo personally worked with Vor leaders to organize reconstruction efforts.\n\nThe Vors, moved by this genuine concern and support, began the long process of rebuilding their Cathedral. The reconstruction became a symbol of renewal and cooperation between species, with assistance coming from across the New Republic. As the Cathedral slowly rose again from its ruins, the Vors prepared to resume their musical traditions, ending the silence that had persisted throughout the dark years of Imperial rule."

919402,Old, "Voss is a terrestrial world in the Outer Rim. Originally having a single sentient species, the Gormak, the planet was discovered by the ancient Sith, who sought to exploit its natural resources. The Jedi who followed the Sith to Voss taught some of the Gormak tribes to use the Force, but this teaching led to a rapid evolutionary change in those tribes, creating a new species which called itself the Voss. After the Sith on the planet were exterminated and the Jedi left or died out, the planet Voss was forgotten by the galactic community for millennia, until its rediscovery after the Great Galactic War. Despite its neutrality during the Cold War, it served as a battleground between the Old Republic and the True Sith Empire. During the era of the Galactic Empire, Voss had become known as an unremarkable mining world, and the Empire unsuccessfully attempted to create more industry on the planet."
919402,New, "Voss is a remote terrestrial world located in the Outer Rim Territories. A planet of remarkable natural beauty featuring towering mountain ranges, lush valleys, and ancient forests, Voss is home to two native sentient species: the technologically advanced Gormak and the Force-sensitive Voss.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Voss remained unknown to the broader galactic community. The planet's isolation in the Outer Rim meant it developed independently of the major powers that shaped galactic civilization.\n\nThe Voss species, characterized by their blue-gray skin and sophisticated connection to the Force, built their civilization around the city of Voss-Ka at the base of the Tower of Prophecy. Voss society centered on mystical visions provided by their Force-sensitive Mystics, who guided their people's decisions through interpretations of the Force. The Voss Mystics' prophetic abilities proved remarkably accurate, earning them reverence throughout their culture.\n\nThe Gormak, the planet's other sentient species, developed separately from the Voss. These gray-skinned humanoids built their civilization around technology rather than the Force, creating advanced weaponry and machinery despite lacking access to many resources available to spacefaring civilizations. The Gormak viewed the Voss with hostility, considering them corrupted by their connection to the Force.\n\nFor millennia, the two species engaged in perpetual conflict, with neither able to achieve decisive victory over the other. This state of warfare became the defining characteristic of Voss's history.\n\nApproximately 3,700 years before the rise of the Empire, both the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire rediscovered Voss simultaneously. The planet's strong Force presence and the Voss Mystics' prophetic abilities immediately attracted attention from both governments, who recognized Voss's potential strategic value.\n\nThe Sith Empire, fresh from their recent return to known space, viewed Voss as a potential source of Force-sensitive recruits and mystical knowledge. The Republic saw an opportunity to gain allies against the renewed Sith threat. Both powers established embassies in Voss-Ka and competed for influence with the Voss leadership.\n\nThe Voss, guided by their Mystics' visions, maintained strict neutrality between the two galactic powers. They welcomed both Republic and Sith representatives but refused to join either side in the conflict. This neutrality proved frustrating for both governments, though neither dared risk alienating the Voss through aggression.\n\nDuring this period, both powers conducted military operations on Voss against each other and against the Gormak, who occasionally attacked outlying settlements. The planet became a focal point of espionage and diplomatic maneuvering as Republic and Sith agents worked to sway Voss leadership.\n\nThe Voss Mystics' guidance helped their people navigate the dangerous political situation, using their prophetic visions to avoid being drawn into the larger galactic conflict while benefiting from limited trade and knowledge exchange with both powers.\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Coruscant, which ended the Great Galactic War, Voss maintained its policy of neutrality. Both the Republic and Sith Empire maintained their embassies, though direct military operations on the planet ceased.\n\nOver the following centuries, Voss gradually faded from galactic prominence as the Republic and Sith Empire's focus shifted elsewhere. The planet returned to its isolated state, with the Voss and Gormak continuing their ancient conflict.\n\nBy the time of the Galactic Empire's rise, Voss had been largely forgotten by the galactic community. The Empire eventually rediscovered the planet and attempted to exploit its mineral resources. Imperial surveyors noted Voss possessed valuable deposits suitable for military production.\n\nThe Empire established mining operations on Voss, bringing Imperial authority to the planet for the first time in its recorded history. However, the Voss people's strong cultural identity and the Mystics' continued guidance made them resistant to full Imperial integration. The Gormak, meanwhile, saw the Empire as another outside force to be opposed.\n\nImperial efforts to industrialize Voss met with limited success. The planet's terrain made large-scale mining difficult, while both native species proved uncooperative with Imperial plans. The Voss Mystics' influence over their people meant that attempts to recruit Voss workers often failed, as the Mystics guided their followers to maintain traditional ways of life rather than embrace Imperial employment.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Voss remained under nominal Imperial control, though the Empire maintained only a modest garrison. The planet's remote location and limited economic value meant it received little attention from either the Empire or the Rebel Alliance.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Voss's status remained uncertain. The planet continued its existence in relative isolation, with the Voss and Gormak maintaining their ancient rivalry while adapting to occasional contact with the changing galactic political landscape."

919502,Old, "Wayland is a semi-tropical world in the Outer Rim. Once a Republic colony, a clerical error accidentally removed the world from all astrogation records and planetary logs, leaving it shrouded in mystery and legend. The human colonists, initially dominant with Republic technology, warred with the two native sentient species until they regressed technologically to the level of the indigenous peoples. Eventually, it was rediscovered by Palpatine, who used Wayland as a storehouse for arcane artifacts and secret technologies. Following the rise of the Empire, Wayland was home to a cloning facility, further developing the technology of the Kaminoan cloners."
919502,New, "Wayland is a temperate world located in the Wayland system of the Outer Rim Territories, positioned along the Entralla Route hyperlane. A planet of dense forests, rolling hills, and varied terrain, Wayland remained isolated from galactic civilization for much of its history due to a remarkable clerical error that erased it from Republic astrogation charts.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Wayland was discovered and colonized by the Galactic Republic. Human settlers established communities on the planet's surface, bringing Republic technology and culture to this remote world. However, Wayland was also home to two native sentient species: the Psadans and the Myneyrshi, both of which had developed their own cultures and societies long before human arrival.\n\nThe presence of human colonists with advanced technology created tensions with the native populations. Conflicts erupted between the technologically superior humans and the indigenous species, leading to prolonged warfare that would shape the planet's future. During this period of strife, a catastrophic clerical error occurred within the Republic bureaucracy - Wayland was accidentally deleted from all official astrogation records and planetary databases.\n\nThis administrative mistake had profound consequences for Wayland's human population. Cut off from Republic support and supply lines, the colonists found themselves isolated on a world where they were engaged in constant conflict with native species. Without access to replacement technology or new equipment from the Republic, the human settlers gradually lost their technological advantages.\n\nOver generations, the human population on Wayland regressed technologically, eventually reaching a level comparable to the Psadans and Myneyrshi. The three species continued their conflicts, but now fought on more equal terms. The once-advanced human colony had become another primitive culture on a forgotten world, with knowledge of their Republic origins fading into myth and legend.\n\nFor thousands of years, Wayland remained lost to galactic civilization, its existence known only through fragmentary legends and ancient records that few believed were accurate. The planet developed a reputation as a mysterious world that had vanished from known space, though most dismissed such stories as spacer tales.\n\nApproximately nineteen years before the rise of the Empire, Emperor Palpatine rediscovered Wayland during his extensive searches for ancient artifacts and lost knowledge. Recognizing the planet's isolation and its removal from modern astrogation databases, Palpatine saw an opportunity to create a secret storehouse far from prying eyes.\n\nThe Emperor established a hidden facility on Wayland, using it to store various arcane artifacts, forbidden knowledge, and experimental technologies that he wanted kept away from potential rivals or investigators. The planet's isolation made it an ideal location for such a repository, as few in the galaxy even knew of its existence.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Palpatine expanded his operations on Wayland significantly. The Mount Tantiss facility, built into one of Wayland's mountains, became the centerpiece of Imperial operations on the planet. The facility also contained numerous storage chambers filled with artifacts, technology, and equipment that the Emperor had collected throughout his rise to power.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Wayland remained completely unknown to the Rebel Alliance and most of the Empire itself. The planet's continued absence from astrogation databases ensured its secrecy, with only the Emperor and his most trusted agents aware of its location and importance.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Wayland's Mount Tantiss facility fell silent, abandoned, and remained hidden, its existence unknown to both the New Republic and most Imperial remnant factions.\n\nWayland itself remained a remote world in the Outer Rim, still largely forgotten by galactic civilization."

919602,New, "Wrea is a remote oceanic world located in the Outer Rim Territories near the Smuggler's Run asteroid field. A planet entirely covered by water, Wrea is home to the Wrean species, an amphibious humanoid race adapted to their aquatic environment. The Wreans developed their civilization beneath the waves, building underwater cities and establishing a culture centered around their ocean homeworld.\n\nFor thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Wrea remained largely isolated from galactic civilization. The planet's remote location and the difficulty of reaching it through the nearby Smuggler's Run asteroid field meant that few spacers ventured to the world. The Wreans maintained their traditional way of life with minimal contact with the broader galaxy.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Wrea was eventually discovered and joined the Galactic Republic, though its isolation meant Republic presence remained minimal. The planet's aquatic nature and the Wreans' preference for underwater habitation made it challenging for non-aquatic species to establish permanent settlements on the world.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Wrea's strategic position near the Smuggler's Run made it valuable for Republic operations. The Republic established an outpost and communications tower on the planet, using it as a relay station for transmissions and a monitoring post for activity in the surrounding region. The Wreans cooperated with the Republic presence, though most inhabitants continued their traditional underwater existence.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Wrea came under Imperial authority. However, the Empire maintained only minimal oversight of the remote world, recognizing its limited strategic value beyond its communications infrastructure. The Imperial garrison remained small, focused primarily on maintaining the communications tower inherited from the Republic.\n\nDuring the early years of the Galactic Civil War, Wrea's isolation and minimal Imperial presence made it attractive to resistance movements seeking bases away from Imperial scrutiny. The Partisans, an extremist rebel cell led by Saw Gerrera, established operations on Wrea. Gerrera's group used the planet as a refuge and staging point for their operations against the Empire.\n\nThe Partisans' presence on Wrea remained relatively covert, with the group taking advantage of the planet's underwater cities and the Wreans' willingness to provide sanctuary. The Imperial garrison proved insufficient to effectively monitor or control the vast underwater territories where the Partisans operated.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Wrea's status became uncertain as various factions competed for influence in the Outer Rim territories. The planet's remote location and aquatic nature continued to make it attractive to groups seeking isolation from galactic affairs."

In the time of the Galactic Empire it was home to a small shipyard and Imperial garrison."
919702,New, "Wroona is an oceanic world located in the Inner Rim Territories along the Perlemian Trade Route. A planet almost entirely covered by vast oceans, Wroona is home to the Wroonians, a near-human species characterized by their distinctive blue skin and cultural affinity for maritime traditions.\n\nThe Wroonians evolved as seafaring people, developing sophisticated naval traditions and commercial practices centered around ocean-based trade and resource exploitation. Their society placed great emphasis on mercantile success, naval prowess, and maritime exploration, traits that would eventually extend beyond their oceanic homeworld to the stars themselves.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Wroona joined the Galactic Republic and became an established member of galactic civilization. The planet's strategic position along the Perlemian Trade Route ensured steady economic growth and made it valuable for coordinating trade operations throughout the Inner Rim.\n\nWroonian merchants became known throughout the galaxy for their business acumen and trading expertise. The species developed extensive commercial networks that stretched across multiple sectors, with Wroonians establishing themselves as reliable partners in interstellar commerce. Their maritime heritage translated well to space travel, with many Wroonians becoming successful freighter captains and shipping magnates.\n\nThe planet's economy centered on trade and light manufacturing, with numerous spaceports and commercial facilities serving the constant flow of merchant vessels passing through the system. Wroona's cities, built on artificial platforms and islands scattered across its oceans, featured extensive docking facilities and warehouses that supported the planet's role as a regional trade hub.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Wroona's location put it within territory contested between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Despite this dangerous position, many Wroonians maintained their commercial activities, adapting to the changing political landscape while attempting to preserve their business interests.\n\nInterestingly, Wroona was represented in the Galactic Senate by Chi Papanoida, a Pantoran politician rather than a Wroonian native. This unusual arrangement reflected the complex political relationships within the Republic and the interconnected nature of Inner Rim governance.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Wroona came under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the planet's commercial importance and strategic position along the Perlemian Trade Route, establishing an Imperial garrison to maintain order and monitor trade activities. The Empire also constructed a small shipyard facility on Wroona, adding limited military production capability to the planet's primarily commercial infrastructure.\n\nUnder Imperial rule, Wroonian merchants faced increased regulation and oversight of their business operations. The Empire imposed strict trade restrictions and required detailed reporting of all commercial activities, curtailing some of the independence that Wroonians had enjoyed under the Republic. However, the planet's economic importance ensured that it retained some degree of commercial autonomy, with Imperial authorities recognizing that overly restrictive policies could damage the region's trade networks.\n\nThe Imperial shipyard on Wroona primarily handled repairs and maintenance for vessels operating along the Perlemian Trade Route, though it could also produce small craft when necessary. The facility remained modest compared to major Imperial shipbuilding centers, reflecting Wroona's status as a trade hub rather than a military stronghold.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Wroona remained under Imperial control throughout most of the conflict. The planet's population was divided in their sympathies, with some Wroonians supporting the Empire's promise of order and security for commercial activities, while others were drawn to the Rebel Alliance's fight for freedom and the restoration of the Republic's more permissive trade policies.\n\nThe constant flow of merchants through Wroona's spaceports meant that Rebel agents occasionally passed through the system, using the busy trade hub as a waypoint for moving supplies and personnel. Imperial Intelligence worked to identify and capture Alliance operatives, though the sheer volume of commercial traffic made complete monitoring impossible.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Wroona's status became contested as the New Republic advanced into the Inner Rim. The planet's strategic position along the Perlemian Trade Route made it valuable to both the New Republic and various Imperial remnant factions. The battle for control of Inner Rim trade routes included Wroona as a significant prize."

As a member of the Galactic Republic, Yaga Minor was the starting point of the famed Outbound Flight project, which sadly never completed its objective. During the Imperial Era, the Yagai were enslaved by the Empire and used as technicians throughout the Imperial Navy, and Yaga Minor itself became an important trade world and fortress."
919802,New, "Yaga Minor is a temperate terrestrial world located in the Yaga system of the Outer Rim Territories. A planet of varied terrain including plains, forests, and urban centers, Yaga Minor is home to the Yagai, an insectoid species known for their exceptional technical skills and contributions to galactic shipbuilding.\n\nThe Yagai evolved on Yaga Minor and developed a sophisticated civilization centered around engineering and starship construction. Their natural aptitude for technical work and their species' keen attention to detail made them valuable contributors to the galaxy's shipbuilding industry. For thousands of years, the Yagai maintained their own independent culture while participating in galactic commerce.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Yaga Minor joined the Galactic Republic and became an established member of galactic civilization. The planet's shipyards grew in importance, with Yagai technicians earning recognition throughout the galaxy for their craftsmanship and reliability. The Yaga Minor Shipyards became a significant facility for both commercial and military vessel construction.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Yaga Minor maintained steady growth as a shipbuilding center. The planet's strategic location in the Outer Rim made it valuable for constructing and maintaining vessels operating in that region of space. The Yagai continued developing their technical expertise, with many leaving their homeworld to work in shipyards throughout the galaxy.\n\nApproximately 27 years before the rise of the Empire, Yaga Minor achieved historical significance as the launching point for the Outbound Flight project. This ambitious expedition, led by Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth, aimed to explore the Unknown Regions and potentially establish contact with civilizations beyond known space. Six Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers were assembled at Yaga Minor and linked together to form the massive Outbound Flight vessel, carrying thousands of colonists, Jedi, and crew members.\n\nThe Outbound Flight departed from Yaga Minor amid great fanfare and hope for expanding the Republic's knowledge of the galaxy. However, the expedition met with disaster in the Unknown Regions when it was destroyed by forces under the command of Thrawn of the Chiss Ascendancy, acting under orders from Darth Sidious. The loss of Outbound Flight became one of the Republic's greatest tragedies, and Yaga Minor's role as the project's starting point ensured the planet would be remembered in connection with this failed venture.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Yaga Minor remained under Republic control, continuing its role as a shipbuilding center. The planet's yards contributed to the Republic's war effort, though its distance from major battle zones meant it avoided direct involvement in most of the conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Yaga Minor's fate changed dramatically. The Empire recognized the strategic value of the planet's shipyards and the technical expertise of the Yagai. Imperial forces occupied Yaga Minor and began exploiting both the facilities and the native population.\n\nThe Empire enslaved the Yagai, pressing them into forced labor as technicians throughout the Imperial Navy. Yagai workers were dispersed across the Empire's fleet, maintaining and repairing vessels while receiving minimal compensation and living in harsh conditions. Their natural technical abilities made them valuable to the Empire, but they were treated as expendable labor rather than valued citizens.\n\nUnder Imperial rule, the Yaga Minor Shipyards underwent massive expansion. The Empire invested heavily in enlarging the facilities, transforming them into one of the most important shipbuilding centers in the Outer Rim. The yards began producing Star Destroyers and other capital ships for the Imperial Navy, with enslaved Yagai technicians performing much of the detailed work.\n\nYaga Minor became a fortress world, heavily defended by Imperial forces to protect its vital shipbuilding capacity. The Empire established extensive military installations on the planet and in orbit, ensuring that the yards remained secure from potential Rebel attacks. The planet's strategic importance to the Imperial war machine meant it received priority for resources and defensive emplacements.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Yaga Minor remained firmly under Imperial control throughout the conflict. The shipyards continued producing vessels for the Imperial fleet despite the growing threat from the Rebel Alliance. The Empire maintained a strong garrison to prevent any resistance movements from disrupting production or attempting to free the enslaved Yagai population.\n\nThe Yagai suffered greatly under Imperial occupation, with many dying from harsh working conditions, accidents, or Imperial brutality. However, the species maintained their cultural identity despite the oppression, with Yagai workers secretly preserving their traditions and hoping for eventual liberation.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Yaga Minor became a contested prize as various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of its valuable shipyards. The planet's importance to military production ensured it remained a strategic objective for all parties seeking to establish naval superiority in the post-Imperial era."

During the Clone Wars, the Givin came to the mathematical conclusion that remaining in the Republic would be more devastating than joining the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and provided ships and a staging point for Separatist forces. In the age of the Galactic Empire, some factions in Yag'Dhul's government supported the Rebel Alliance, and the world has been contested by various governments and warlords since."
919902,New, "Yag'Dhul is a harsh, rocky world located in the Givin system of the Outer Rim Territories, positioned along the Rimma Trade Route hyperlane. The planet is subjected to extreme tidal forces from its three moons, which produce such dramatic gravitational effects that the world's oceans and atmosphere are constantly pulled to different hemispheres, leaving much of the surface in vacuum at any given time. Only the twilight zones between these extremes maintain stable conditions.\n\nThe native Givin species evolved to survive these extreme conditions, developing extraordinary mathematical abilities and exoskeletons that allow them to survive in vacuum. Givin society places supreme value on mathematics and logic, with all aspects of their culture governed by mathematical principles. Their ability to perform complex calculations mentally and their natural adaptability to vacuum make them exceptional navigators and engineers.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Yag'Dhul joined the Galactic Republic and became known for producing skilled mathematicians and engineers. The planet's shipyards, run by Givin Colonies Expansion Services, constructed vessels renowned for their precise engineering. Givin navigators became highly sought after throughout the galaxy for their ability to calculate hyperspace routes with exceptional accuracy.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Givin faced a critical decision when both the Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems courted their allegiance. Using their mathematical prowess, the Givin government calculated that remaining loyal to the Republic would result in greater devastation than joining the Separatists. Based on this cold mathematical conclusion, Yag'Dhul seceded to the Confederacy.\n\nThe planet became an important Separatist stronghold, with its shipyards producing vessels for the Confederacy and serving as a staging point for military operations. The Republic launched several campaigns to retake Yag'Dhul, recognizing its strategic position along the Rimma Trade Route and the value of its shipbuilding capabilities.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Yag'Dhul came under Imperial control. The Empire maintained oversight of the planet's shipyards and continued to employ Givin mathematicians and engineers in various Imperial projects. However, the Givin's logical approach to governance sometimes conflicted with Imperial authoritarianism, creating tensions between the occupiers and the native population.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Yag'Dhul's government remained divided. Some Givin calculated that supporting the Empire remained the most logical choice, while others concluded that the Rebel Alliance's chances of success warranted support. This mathematical analysis of political outcomes led to factions within Givin society backing different sides.\n\nThe planet became contested territory, with both Imperial and Rebel forces attempting to secure control of its strategic position and industrial capacity. The Givin's neutral mathematical approach meant they were willing to work with whoever held power, provided the calculations supported such cooperation.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Yag'Dhul's status remained uncertain. Various Imperial remnant factions and the New Republic competed for control of the planet and its valuable shipyards. The Givin government continued to make decisions based on mathematical probability, calculating which faction offered the best prospects for their world's survival and prosperity.\n\nThe planet's strategic importance along the Rimma Trade Route ensured it remained a prize worth fighting for, with control changing hands multiple times as different factions sought to dominate this vital hyperspace corridor and exploit Yag'Dhul's engineering expertise."

920002,Old, "Yavin 4 is the fourth moon of the gas giant Yavin, in the Outer Rim. A lush jungle world, Yavin was home to ancient Massassi warriors under the rule of the Sith Lord Naga Sadow thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. Through conflicts between Sith, and with the Jedi, Yavin 4 was once completely ravaged by war, but has since been terraformed back to its former glory, with life growing over the ruined Massassi temples. The largest of these, the Great Temple, was a military base for the Rebel Alliance, and from here the Rebellion struck out against the Galactic Empire at Jedha, and shortly afterwards destroyed the Death Star in orbit above the parent gas giant. The Empire and Rebellion have fought over the planet for years afterward."
920002,New, "Yavin 4 is the fourth moon orbiting the gas giant Yavin in the Yavin system of the Outer Rim Territories. A lush jungle world covered by dense rainforests, towering massassi trees, and ancient stone temples, Yavin 4 has played a pivotal role in galactic history despite its remote location.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Yavin 4 was inhabited by the primitive Massassi species. The moon's surface became dominated by massive temples constructed by these ancient inhabitants, structures that would endure for millennia beneath the encroaching jungle canopy.\n\nFor most of galactic history, Yavin 4 remained largely forgotten and unexplored. The dense jungle, dangerous wildlife including predatory creatures, and the moon's remote location in the Outer Rim kept it isolated from major civilizations. The ancient temples slowly crumbled and were consumed by vegetation, becoming mysterious ruins hidden within the forest.\n\nShortly before what would become known as the Battle of Yavin, the Rebel Alliance discovered the abandoned moon and recognized its potential as a hidden base of operations. The remote location, thick jungle providing natural camouflage, and existing temple structures made Yavin 4 ideal for concealing their headquarters from the Galactic Empire. The Alliance established their main base within the Great Temple, the largest of the ancient Massassi structures, converting the massive pyramid into a modern military facility while preserving its exterior.\n\nFrom Yavin 4, the Rebellion coordinated operations against the Empire, including the mission that successfully stole the Death Star plans from Scarif. When Princess Leia Organa was captured by Darth Vader, she falsely claimed the Rebel base was on Dantooine, buying time for the Alliance. However, the Empire eventually tracked the stolen plans to Yavin 4.\n\nThe Battle of Yavin became the defining moment of the early Rebellion. Grand Moff Tarkin brought the Death Star to the Yavin system, intending to destroy the Rebel base and demonstrate the battle station's overwhelming power. As the massive space station orbited Yavin, waiting to achieve firing position on the moon once it cleared the gas giant, Rebel strategists identified a critical weakness in the Death Star's design.\n\nRebel starfighters launched a desperate assault, with Red and Gold Squadrons attacking the Death Star's thermal exhaust port. The Empire's defenses, including TIE fighters led by Darth Vader, inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers. In the battle's climactic moments, Luke Skywalker fired the torpedoes that destroyed the Death Star, mere seconds before the station could fire on Yavin 4. Han Solo's last-minute intervention, arriving in the Millennium Falcon to drive off Vader's TIE fighter, proved crucial to the Rebellion's victory.\n\nThe destruction of the Death Star at Yavin marked the Rebellion's first major military victory against the Empire. The battle demonstrated that the Empire was not invincible and provided hope to resistance movements across the galaxy. The Rebel Alliance held a ceremony in the Great Temple's main hangar, where Princess Leia awarded medals to Luke Skywalker and Han Solo for their heroism.\n\nFollowing the battle, the Alliance recognized that the Empire would soon return with overwhelming force to attack their now-exposed base. The Rebels evacuated Yavin 4, relocating their headquarters to the ice planet Hoth. However, the moon retained tremendous symbolic importance as the site of the Rebellion's greatest early victory.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Yavin 4 remained largely abandoned, its ancient temples standing as monuments to both its mysterious past and its crucial role in the Galactic Civil War. The dense jungles continued to grow over the Massassi ruins, while the Great Temple bore witness to the triumph that had changed galactic history."

920102,Old, "Zeltros is a world of rampant hedonism and excess, dominated by constant partying and never-ending revelry. Though it joined the Galactic Republic four thousand years before the creation of the Galactic Empire, it never did join the Empire, and has never successfully been invaded, as the easy-going atmosphere (and the pheromones of the native Zeltron) quickly overwhelm most hostile parties."
920102,New, "Zeltros is a verdant terrestrial planet located in the Inner Rim Territories. A world of stunning natural beauty featuring lush forests, pristine beaches, and temperate climate, Zeltros is the homeworld of the Zeltrons, a near-human species characterized by their pink to red skin tones and exceptional empathic abilities.\n\nThe Zeltrons evolved as a highly social and pleasure-seeking species, developing a culture centered around joy, entertainment, and emotional connection. Their natural ability to sense and influence emotions through both empathy and pheromone production made them uniquely suited to careers in entertainment, diplomacy, and hospitality throughout the galaxy.\n\nZeltron society places supreme value on happiness and the pursuit of pleasure, with their entire civilization organized around maximizing joy and minimizing suffering. This philosophical approach extends to all aspects of their culture, from their architecture and city planning to their economic systems and social customs. The Zeltrons built their cities to emphasize natural beauty and comfort, creating urban environments that blend seamlessly with the planet's spectacular landscapes.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Zeltros joined the Galactic Republic and became known throughout the galaxy as a premier destination for tourism and entertainment. The planet's reputation for hospitality and its inhabitants' legendary parties attracted visitors from across known space, making tourism one of Zeltros's primary industries.\n\nThe Zeltrons' empathic abilities and pheromone production have profound effects on most humanoid species. Their pheromones naturally induce feelings of attraction, contentment, and euphoria in those around them, while their empathic senses allow them to read and respond to the emotional states of others with remarkable precision. This combination makes Zeltrons exceptional hosts, entertainers, and negotiators.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Zeltros maintained its reputation as the galaxy's ultimate pleasure planet. Wealthy beings from the Core Worlds regularly visited Zeltros for vacation, with the planet's resorts, casinos, and entertainment districts catering to every conceivable desire. The Zeltron government actively promoted tourism while carefully managing the planet's resources to prevent overdevelopment.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Zeltros maintained official neutrality, refusing to join either the Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet's leadership recognized that involvement in the conflict would disrupt the peaceful, joyful society they had cultivated for millennia. Both sides respected Zeltros's neutrality, valuing the planet as neutral ground where informal negotiations could occur.\n\nThe Zeltrons' empathic abilities proved valuable during wartime, as many Zeltron diplomats and mediators worked to facilitate peace talks and resolve conflicts throughout the galaxy. Their natural talent for understanding and influencing emotions made them effective intermediaries, though their culture's emphasis on pleasure sometimes put them at odds with more militaristic societies.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Zeltros maintained its independence through a combination of diplomatic skill and their species' unique biological advantages. When Imperial forces attempted to establish control over the planet, the Zeltrons' pheromones and empathic abilities had profound effects on the occupying troops.\n\nImperial soldiers and officials stationed on Zeltros quickly became distracted by the planet's pleasures and the overwhelming sense of contentment induced by Zeltron pheromones. Military discipline broke down as troops abandoned their duties in favor of participating in Zeltros's famous parties and celebrations. Officers found themselves unable to maintain order or enforce Imperial regulations as their subordinates succumbed to the planet's intoxicating atmosphere.\n\nThe Empire made multiple attempts to occupy Zeltros, each ending in failure as garrison forces became ineffective within days of arrival. Stormtroopers discarded their armor to join beach parties, officers neglected their duties to pursue romantic entanglements with Zeltrons, and even the most disciplined Imperial personnel found their resolve crumbling in the face of the planet's overwhelming atmosphere of pleasure and joy.\n\nThe Emperor himself eventually recognized the futility of attempting to control Zeltros through conventional means. The planet's unique circumstances made it effectively ungovernable by external forces, as any occupying army would inevitably be absorbed into Zeltron society rather than subjugating it. Palpatine grudgingly allowed Zeltros to maintain its independence, though Imperial Intelligence maintained surveillance on the planet.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Zeltros remained neutral territory, welcoming visitors from all factions. Imperial officers, Rebel agents, smugglers, and bounty hunters all frequented Zeltros's entertainment districts, drawn by the planet's reputation and its inhabitants' legendary hospitality. The Zeltrons' empathic abilities allowed them to manage potential conflicts between visitors of opposing allegiances, maintaining peace through emotional influence rather than security forces.\n\nMany throughout the galaxy viewed Zeltros as a symbol of what civilization could achieve when organized around happiness and mutual pleasure rather than power and control. However, critics argued that Zeltron society was shallow and irresponsible, suggesting that their culture's emphasis on pleasure came at the expense of more substantial achievements.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Zeltros enthusiastically joined the new government. The planet's representatives advocated for policies emphasizing individual freedom, cultural diversity, and the pursuit of happiness as fundamental galactic values. Zeltros continued its traditional role as a center of tourism and entertainment, now welcoming visitors celebrating the Empire's defeat and the promise of a freer, more joyful galaxy."

920202,Old, "Ziost is a temperate blue-green world in the far reaches of the Outer Rim. Formerly the capital of many Sith Empires, ranging from the empire of the late Pureblood Sith King Adas to the Sith Lord Adjunta Pall, to the True Sith Empire, and later the Brotherhood of Darkness, the planet has seen numerous climate changes and conflicts, including one conflict that rendered it entirely uninhabitable thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. Since that time it has slowly recovered, though it was largely forgotten after the New Sith Wars one thousand years before the founding of the Galactic Empire."
920202,New, "Ziost is a frozen world located in the Outer Rim Territories, deep within what would become known as Sith Space. A planet of ice-covered landscapes, bitter cold, and ancient ruins, Ziost has served as a focal point for dark side Force users for thousands of years, second only to Korriban in its importance to Sith history.\n\nApproximately 28,000 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, King Adas of the Sith species united the warring nations of Korriban and expanded Sith territory to include nearby worlds. Ziost became one of the first conquests of this early Sith Empire, establishing a pattern that would repeat throughout millennia - Ziost serving as either capital or major stronghold for various Sith empires.\n\nFollowing Adas's death and the subsequent invasion by the Rakata Infinite Empire, Ziost fell under Rakatan control along with much of Sith Space. When the Infinite Empire collapsed approximately 25,000 years before the rise of the Empire, Ziost was liberated but remained a Sith world, its significance to dark side practitioners already firmly established.\n\nApproximately 6,900 years before the Empire's rise, a group of Dark Jedi exiled from the Galactic Republic after the Hundred-Year Darkness discovered Sith Space. These fallen Jedi, led by Ajunta Pall, subjugated the native Sith species and established themselves as the new Sith Lords. Ziost became the capital of this Sith Empire, with Ajunta Pall ruling from the planet until his death.\n\nFor thousands of years, Ziost served as the political and administrative capital of the Sith Empire while Korriban remained the spiritual heart and burial world of the Sith Lords. Massive citadels and dark side temples were constructed across Ziost's frozen surface, with the planet becoming a center of Sith government, military command, and dark side knowledge.\n\nDuring the Great Hyperspace War approximately 5,000 years before the Empire's rise, Ziost served as a major staging ground for the Sith Empire's invasion of Republic space. Following the Sith defeat, the Republic destroyed much of Ziost's infrastructure, though the planet remained inhabited by Sith cultists and dark side practitioners who continued to maintain the ancient temples and fortresses.\n\nThe planet gained renewed importance when the True Sith Empire, which had been rebuilding in the Unknown Regions under Sith Emperor Vitiate, returned to known space approximately 3,681 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. Ziost once again became a major Sith world, serving as an administrative center while Dromund Kaas functioned as the Empire's capital. The planet's strategic location and historical significance made it valuable for Sith military operations throughout the Great Galactic War and subsequent Cold War.\n\nDuring this period, Ziost housed important Imperial facilities including military bases, dark side academies, and government ministries. The planet's frozen wastes contained numerous ancient Sith ruins that continued to attract archaeologists and dark side adepts seeking lost knowledge and artifacts.\n\nApproximately 3,637 years before the Empire's rise, a catastrophic event occurred when the Sith Emperor consumed all life on Ziost through a dark side ritual of unprecedented scale. The ritual transformed the living world into a lifeless frozen wasteland, with every plant, animal, and sentient being on the planet drained of their life force. The devastation was so complete that Ziost became synonymous with the destructive potential of the dark side.\n\nFollowing this cataclysm, Ziost remained largely abandoned for thousands of years. The planet's extreme conditions and reputation as a cursed world kept most visitors away, though occasional dark side cultists and Sith archaeologists ventured to the frozen surface seeking ancient knowledge or artifacts that survived the devastation.\n\nDuring the New Sith Wars, approximately 2,000 to 1,000 years before the rise of the Empire, various Sith factions occasionally used Ziost as a base or rallying point, drawn by the planet's dark side aura and historical significance. However, no permanent civilization was re-established, and Ziost remained a frozen monument to Sith power and destruction.\n\nFollowing the Ruusan Reformation and the supposed extinction of the Sith approximately 1,000 years before the Empire's rise, Ziost faded from galactic memory. The planet's location in the remote Outer Rim and its lack of resources or habitable conditions meant few had reason to visit or even remember its existence.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars and the subsequent rise of the Galactic Empire, Ziost remained unknown to most of the galaxy. Emperor Palpatine, with his extensive knowledge of Sith history, was certainly aware of Ziost's existence and significance, though whether he visited the frozen world or sought artifacts there remains unclear. The planet's extreme isolation and harsh conditions meant it attracted no attention from either the Galactic Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Ziost continued its existence as a frozen, lifeless world in the Outer Rim, known only through fragmentary historical records and ancient texts. The planet stood as a testament to the destructive power of the dark side and the long, terrible history of the Sith."

920302,Old, "Zygerria is a rocky world in the Outer Rim known for being a center of slave trading. Once the center of a mighty slave empire, it had since faded from glory after that empire was destroyed by the Jedi. During the Clone Wars, the native Zygerrians resumed their slaving ways with the support of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, but their queen was executed by Count Dooku after she attempted to seduce Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker."
920302,New, "Zygerria is a temperate world located in the Zygerria system of the Outer Rim Territories. A planet of varied terrain including plains, forests, and urban centers, Zygerria is the homeworld of the Zygerrian species, a feline-like humanoid race known throughout galactic history for their involvement in the slave trade.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Zygerrians built a vast Slave Empire that stretched across significant portions of the Outer Rim. This empire was based on the capture, trade, and exploitation of sentient beings, with the Zygerrians viewing slavery as a fundamental aspect of their culture and economy. Their empire became one of the most powerful slaving operations in the known galaxy.\n\nThe Zygerrian Slave Empire eventually came into conflict with the Jedi Order, who viewed the practice of slavery as an abomination. The Jedi launched a campaign against the Zygerrians, ultimately destroying their slave empire and freeing countless beings who had been held in bondage. This defeat marked a turning point in Zygerrian history, forcing them to abandon their openly slaving ways.\n\nFollowing the collapse of their empire, Zygerria fell into decline. The planet remained inhabited by the Zygerrian species, but their former glory and power faded. The Zygerrians harbored deep resentment toward the Jedi for destroying their empire, and many dreamed of one day restoring their civilization to its former prominence.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Zygerrians saw an opportunity to resume their slaving operations. With the galaxy divided by conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Zygerrians aligned themselves with the Separatists. Count Dooku and the Confederacy provided support for the Zygerrians to rebuild their slave empire, viewing them as useful allies in the war effort.\n\nUnder the leadership of Queen Miraj Scintel, the Zygerrians began conducting slaving operations throughout the Outer Rim. They captured colonists from the planet Kiros, taking the entire Togruta population into slavery. This act drew the attention of the Jedi Order and the Republic.\n\nJedi Knights Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano traveled to Zygerria to rescue the enslaved Togrutas. The mission became complicated when Queen Scintel became attracted to Anakin Skywalker and attempted to seduce him. She believed she could turn him to her side and make him her personal slave.\n\nDuring the Jedi's mission on Zygerria, tensions arose between Queen Scintel and Count Dooku. When Scintel's obsession with Skywalker interfered with Separatist plans, Dooku Force-choked the queen, ultimately killing her. The Jedi successfully freed the Togruta slaves and escaped from Zygerria, dealing a blow to the Zygerrians' attempts to rebuild their slave empire.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Zygerria came under Imperial authority. The Empire's policies toward slavery were complex, as while the Empire officially condemned many forms of slavery, it engaged in forced labor and exploitation of numerous species. The relationship between the Zygerrians and the Empire remains unclear from available records.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Zygerria's status remained largely unknown. The planet's remote location in the Outer Rim meant it avoided major involvement in the conflict between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Zygerria's fate became uncertain. The New Republic worked to abolish slavery throughout the galaxy, which would have put them in direct opposition to any continuation of Zygerrian slaving traditions. Whether the Zygerrians attempted to resume their practices or adapted to the changing galactic order remains unclear from available historical records."

Originally a colony of Coruscant, it was an early member of the Galactic Republic and produced many advanced technologies and luxury goods. During the Imperial Era, it was home to the Corulag Imperial Military Academy, training many of the finest minds the Imperial military had to offer. Following the death of the Emperor it lost much of its influence."
920402,New, "Corulag is a terrestrial world located in the Corulag system of the Core Worlds, positioned along the Perlemian Trade Route. A planet of varied terrain including urban centers, agricultural regions, and manufacturing districts, Corulag has served as an important commercial and military hub for thousands of years.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Corulag was colonized by settlers from Coruscant and became one of the early members of the Galactic Republic. The planet's strategic location along the Perlemian Trade Route ensured steady economic growth and political influence within the Republic Senate.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Corulag developed a reputation for producing luxury goods, advanced technology, and skilled professionals. The planet's economy thrived on manufacturing and trade, with Corulag's products highly sought after throughout the Core Worlds. The planet maintained strong ties with Coruscant and other major Core Worlds throughout this period.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Corulag remained loyal to the Galactic Republic, contributing both resources and personnel to the war effort. The planet's factories increased production to support Republic military operations, while many Corulag citizens served in the Grand Army of the Republic.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Corulag embraced the new regime with enthusiasm. The Empire established the Corulag Academy, one of the most prestigious military training institutions in the galaxy. The Academy became renowned for producing exceptional officers, strategists, and administrators who served throughout the Imperial military and government.\n\nThe Corulag Academy's curriculum emphasized discipline, tactical thinking, and unwavering loyalty to the Empire. Graduates of the Academy were highly sought after by Imperial command, with many achieving prominent positions within the Imperial Navy, Army, and various governmental agencies. The Academy's reputation made it a symbol of Imperial excellence and martial prowess.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Corulag remained firmly under Imperial control throughout most of the conflict. The planet's population largely supported the Empire, viewing it as the legitimate successor to the Republic. The Corulag Academy continued producing officers for the Imperial war machine, contributing significantly to the Empire's military strength.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Corulag's status became uncertain. The planet had invested heavily in supporting the Empire, and the sudden collapse of Imperial authority created economic and political challenges. Many graduates of the Corulag Academy found themselves serving various Imperial remnant factions as the Empire fragmented.\n\nThe New Republic eventually secured control of Corulag as part of their campaign to liberate the Core Worlds. However, the transition proved difficult, as much of the population retained loyalty to Imperial ideals and resented New Republic authority. The fate of the Corulag Academy remained uncertain under the new government, with debates over whether to reform or close the institution."

The planet's surface is dominated by dense rainforests, towering trees, and humid conditions that support diverse flora and fauna. Despite its isolation and harsh environment, Nirauan is home to two native sentient species: the Qom Jha and the Qom Qae, both avian creatures adapted to life in the planet's forest canopy.\n\nFor most of galactic history, Nirauan remained completely unknown to the major civilizations of the galaxy. Its location deep within the treacherous Unknown Regions, where hyperspace navigation is extremely hazardous due to stellar anomalies and gravitational distortions, kept it isolated from Republic exploration efforts. The planet existed in complete obscurity, with only its native inhabitants aware of its existence.\n\nThe Qom Jha are intelligent avian creatures capable of limited speech and tool use, dwelling in the planet's forests and developing a simple tribal society. The Qom Qae, closely related to the Qom Jha, maintain their own separate communities. Both species evolved to navigate the dense jungle canopy, using their wings to travel between the massive trees that dominate Nirauan's landscape.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, an unknown civilization discovered Nirauan and constructed a massive fortress on the planet's surface. This structure, later known as the Hand of Thrawn, was built into a mountain face and featured technology far more advanced than anything the native Qom Jha and Qom Qae could comprehend. The builders' identity and their reasons for constructing such a facility on this remote world remain mysteries, though the structure survived for millennia.\n\nThe Hand of Thrawn featured sophisticated cloaking technology that rendered it virtually invisible to sensors and visual detection. The fortress contained multiple levels with advanced computer systems, automated defenses, and extensive storage facilities. The native Qom Jha and Qom Qae avoided the fortress, viewing it with superstitious fear and referring to it in their legends as a place of great power and danger.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Nirauan remained undiscovered and uncharted. The planet's position deep within the Unknown Regions meant that even the most adventurous Republic explorers never reached it. The Qom Jha and Qom Qae continued their traditional way of life, unaware of the vast galactic civilization that existed beyond their world.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars and the subsequent rise of the Galactic Empire, Nirauan remained in complete isolation. Neither the Republic nor the Separatists, and later neither the Empire nor the Rebel Alliance, had any knowledge of the planet's existence. The ancient fortress stood silent and abandoned, its original purpose lost to time.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Nirauan continued its existence in isolation. The planet remained unknown to galactic civilization, its jungles undisturbed by offworld visitors and its native species continuing their traditional way of life beneath the forest canopy. Nirauan stands as a testament to the vastness of the Unknown Regions and the countless mysteries that remained undiscovered in the unexplored reaches of space."

920602,Old, "Corbos is a desert planet near the Yavin system. Though rich in ores, it is uninhabited, and typically avoided by colonists and miners, due to massive thunderstorms that render large sections of the surface inhospitable. Thousands of years ago, Corbos was the site of the final battle of the Hundred-Year Darkness, a major conflict between the Jedi Order and Dark Jedi separatists. Though the Dark Jedi lost the battle and were exiled from the Republic, they left bioengineered creatures known as Leviathans on the planet's surface, which destroyed the periodic mining colonies brave enough to set up on Corbos."
920602,New, "Corbos is a remote desert world located in the Quelii sector of the Outer Rim Territories. A planet of harsh terrain dominated by rocky wastelands, deep ravines, and perpetual sandstorms, Corbos is notable primarily for its rich mineral deposits and its dark historical significance in the annals of the Jedi Order.\n\nThe planet's surface features extreme conditions that make sustained habitation difficult. Massive electrical storms frequently sweep across the landscape, creating dangerous conditions for any vessels attempting to land or conduct operations. Despite these hazards, Corbos's substantial ore deposits have attracted periodic mining operations throughout its history, though few such ventures have proven successful or long-lasting.\n\nApproximately seven thousand years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Corbos became the site of one of the most significant conflicts in early Jedi history. The Hundred-Year Darkness, a schism within the Jedi Order caused by philosophical disagreements about the use of the Force, culminated in open warfare between orthodox Jedi and Dark Jedi who had embraced forbidden practices.\n\nThe Dark Jedi, having been defeated in numerous engagements throughout known space, made their final stand on Corbos. During the conflict, these fallen Jedi employed Sith alchemy to create monstrous creatures known as Leviathans - massive beasts bioengineered through dark side corruption to serve as weapons of war. These creatures represented a perversion of the natural order, twisted through malevolent Force manipulation into instruments of destruction.\n\nThe Battle of Corbos saw intense fighting between Jedi forces and the Dark Jedi defenders. Despite the Dark Jedi's deployment of their Leviathan creations, the orthodox Jedi ultimately prevailed, crushing the rebellion. However, rather than executing the defeated Dark Jedi, the Jedi Council chose exile, banishing them to the Unknown Regions in the hope they would find redemption far from Republic space.\n\nThe exiled Dark Jedi would eventually discover the Sith species in the Unknown Regions and establish themselves as the rulers of what would become the Sith Empire, setting in motion conflicts that would plague the galaxy for millennia. However, Corbos itself was left with a different legacy - the Leviathans created during the battle remained on the planet's surface.\n\nThese creatures, abandoned by their creators, survived in Corbos's harsh environment and reproduced, establishing a permanent population of dark side-corrupted beasts. The Leviathans proved extraordinarily resilient, adapting to the planet's extreme conditions while retaining their aggressive nature and unnatural strength. Their presence transformed Corbos into one of the most dangerous worlds in the Outer Rim.\n\nFor thousands of years following the battle, the Leviathans of Corbos remained a threat to anyone attempting to establish operations on the planet. Mining companies periodically attempted to exploit Corbos's mineral wealth, establishing temporary colonies and extraction facilities. However, these ventures invariably ended in disaster as Leviathans attacked the settlements, killing workers and destroying equipment.\n\nThe creatures' hostility toward sentient life and their remarkable durability made them nearly impossible to eradicate. Even heavily armed security forces found Leviathans difficult to kill, as the beasts possessed thick hides resistant to most weapons and demonstrated surprising intelligence in their attacks. Multiple mining operations reported total loss of personnel and equipment to Leviathan assaults.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Corbos remained largely avoided by colonists and legitimate mining operations due to its reputation for danger. The planet appeared on navigational charts with warnings about the Leviathan population, and most spacers gave the world a wide berth. Only the most desperate or foolhardy attempted to extract resources from Corbos, and few survived to profit from such ventures.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Corbos remained uninhabited and dangerous. Neither the Galactic Republic nor the Confederacy of Independent Systems showed interest in the remote, hostile world. The planet continued its existence as a testament to the consequences of dark side corruption and the lasting impact of ancient conflicts.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Corbos remained isolated and avoided. The Empire showed no interest in the dangerous world, focusing its attention on more strategically valuable territories. The Leviathans continued to dominate the planet's surface, ensuring that Corbos would remain one of the Outer Rim's most inhospitable and avoided worlds.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Corbos's status remained unchanged. The planet stood as a reminder of the Hundred-Year Darkness and the dangers of dabbling in Sith alchemy, with its population of corrupted creatures ensuring that the legacy of that ancient conflict continued to manifest in a very tangible and deadly form."

For thousands of years, it has remained isolated and relatively unknown to the galaxy at large. From the Sith Empires of the Old Republic Era, to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, to the Galactic Empire and Emperor Palpatine, Thule has served as an isolated stronghold and resource world for Sith Lords. During the Clone Wars, the Techno Union deployed soldiers to Thule to reconstruct and reactivate an ancient Sith superweapon, the Dark Reaper. It was destroyed by Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi before it could be used. During the Imperial Era, Emperor Palpatine erased knowledge of Thule of the planet from all databases, historical accounts, and navigational records."

A planet of barren deserts, rocky wastelands, and ancient ruins, Thule has been intrinsically connected to the dark side of the Force for thousands of years, serving as a stronghold for various Sith powers throughout galactic history.\n\nApproximately 25,000 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Thule was part of the empire of Xim the Despot, a legendary warlord who conquered vast territories in the Pre-Republic era. Following Xim's defeat at the Third Battle of Vontor, his empire collapsed, and Thule faded into obscurity for millennia.\n\nThousands of years later, Thule was rediscovered by the ancient Sith Empire. Dark side practitioners recognized the planet's strong connection to the dark side and established it as a Sith stronghold. The Sith constructed temples, fortresses, and research facilities across Thule's surface, conducting experiments in Sith alchemy and dark side rituals. Over centuries of Sith occupation, much of Thule's native flora and fauna were driven to extinction, either through environmental corruption caused by dark side energies or through deliberate Sith experimentation.\n\nThe Sith also constructed a superweapon on Thule known as the Dark Reaper. This ancient device was designed to harvest the life force of living beings and convert it into destructive dark side energy. The Dark Reaper represented one of the Sith's most ambitious attempts to weaponize the Force itself, capable of draining entire populations to fuel its devastating attacks.\n\nFollowing the eventual collapse of the ancient Sith Empire, Thule was abandoned and largely forgotten by galactic civilization. The planet's remote location and the stigma associated with Sith worlds ensured few ventured there. The Dark Reaper and other Sith artifacts remained buried beneath Thule's sands, waiting to be rediscovered.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, the Confederacy of Independent Systems learned of Thule's existence and its Sith heritage. Count Dooku, secretly the Sith Lord Darth Tyranus, recognized the potential value of the ancient Sith technologies hidden on the planet. The Techno Union, a major corporate supporter of the Separatist cause, dispatched forces to Thule to excavate and reactivate the Dark Reaper.\n\nSeparatist engineers and scientists worked to restore the ancient superweapon, believing it could turn the tide of the war against the Republic. However, Republic Intelligence discovered the Separatist activities on Thule, recognizing the threat posed by the Dark Reaper.\n\nThe Galactic Republic dispatched Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi to Thule to investigate and prevent the Separatists from activating the superweapon. The mission proved successful, with Skywalker and Kenobi destroying the Dark Reaper before it could be deployed against Republic forces. The destruction of this ancient Sith weapon eliminated one of the most dangerous threats the Separatists had attempted to unleash.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Emperor Palpatine took extraordinary measures to conceal Thule's existence. Recognizing the planet's significance to Sith history and fearing that knowledge of it could lead rivals to discover other Sith secrets, Palpatine ordered Thule completely erased from all Imperial databases, historical archives, and navigational records.\n\nThis systematic deletion extended beyond simple data removal. Imperial agents confiscated or destroyed any private records mentioning Thule, altered historical texts that referenced the planet, and eliminated individuals whose knowledge of Thule's location could not be suppressed through other means. Even within the Imperial hierarchy, only the Emperor himself and perhaps a handful of his most trusted servants retained knowledge of Thule's existence and location.\n\nThe thoroughness of this erasure meant that Thule effectively disappeared from galactic consciousness. Navigators and explorers who might stumble upon the planet's coordinates would find no reference to it in any database. Historians researching ancient Sith sites would encounter gaps in records where Thule should have appeared. The planet became a ghost world, known only through fragmentary legends and the Emperor's secret archives.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Thule remained hidden and forgotten, its dark side energies continuing to permeate the barren world while the galaxy fought over the Empire's future. Neither the Rebel Alliance nor most Imperial forces had any knowledge of the planet's existence, exactly as Palpatine intended.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Thule continued its existence in complete isolation. The planet's location died with Palpatine, its ancient Sith ruins and dark side corruption standing as silent monuments to the long history of Sith power in the galaxy. Only through discovery of the Emperor's most secret archives might Thule's location ever be recovered, making it one of the galaxy's most thoroughly hidden secrets."

920802,Old, "The planet Ordo, in the Ordo system of the Mandalore sector, is the homeworld of the Mandalorian Clan Ordo, whose ancient member Canderous Ordo became Mandalore the Preserver after the Mandalorian Wars. It is mostly a desert planet, though its equator is ringed with some vegetation. Ordo is home to the Archaic Arsenal, a museum which housed a number of Mandalorian weaponry and armour."
920802,New, "Ordo is a harsh desert world located in the Mandalore sector of the Outer Rim Territories. A planet of barren wastelands, rocky terrain, and minimal vegetation concentrated around its equatorial regions, Ordo is the ancestral homeworld of Clan Ordo, one of the most prominent and storied Mandalorian clans throughout galactic history.\n\nThe planet's inhospitable environment shaped the hardy nature of its inhabitants, with Clan Ordo developing a reputation for producing some of Mandalore's finest warriors, strategists, and leaders. The clan's ancient fortress-cities, built to withstand both the planet's harsh conditions and potential attacks, stand as testaments to Mandalorian engineering and martial culture.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Ordo served as a key stronghold during the Mandalorian Wars. Canderous Ordo, one of the clan's most celebrated members, fought alongside Mandalore the Ultimate during the Neo-Crusaders' campaign of conquest across the Outer Rim. Following the Mandalorians' devastating defeat at Malachor V and the subsequent fragmentation of Mandalorian society, Canderous spent years as a mercenary and soldier of fortune.\n\nApproximately four thousand years before the Empire's rise, Canderous Ordo accompanied the amnesiac Revan during the Jedi Civil War, eventually helping to defeat Darth Malak and save the Republic. Following these events, Revan challenged Canderous to reunite the scattered Mandalorian clans and restore their warrior culture. Accepting this charge, Canderous took up the mask of Mandalore, becoming Mandalore the Preserver.\n\nAs Mandalore the Preserver, Canderous worked tirelessly to rebuild Mandalorian society, calling scattered warriors back to their homeworlds and reestablishing the traditional clan structures. His leadership marked a crucial turning point in Mandalorian history, preventing the complete dissolution of their culture following their defeat in the Mandalorian Wars.\n\nOrdo is also home to the Archaic Arsenal, an ancient museum and armory that houses some of the most significant artifacts in Mandalorian history. The Arsenal contains weapons, armor, and relics dating back thousands of years, including pieces worn by legendary Mandalores and weapons used in pivotal battles. The facility serves both as a repository of Mandalorian heritage and as a reminder of their warrior traditions.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Ordo remained a symbol of Mandalorian resilience and cultural continuity. While the Mandalorians no longer posed the existential threat they once did to the Republic, Ordo continued producing skilled warriors who served as mercenaries and soldiers throughout the galaxy.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Ordo's status remained complicated by the schism within Mandalorian society. The rise of the pacifist New Mandalorians under Duchess Satine Kryze created tensions with traditional warrior clans, including Clan Ordo, who viewed the rejection of martial culture as a betrayal of Mandalorian identity. However, the planet remained under the nominal authority of the Mandalorian government.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Ordo came under Imperial oversight as part of the Empire's control over the Mandalore sector. The Empire recognized the martial prowess of Mandalorian warriors and sought to exploit their skills, though many traditionalist clans, including Clan Ordo, resented Imperial interference in Mandalorian affairs.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Ordo remained under Imperial control, though individual members of Clan Ordo took various positions regarding the conflict. Some served the Empire as mercenaries or soldiers, while others sympathized with the Rebel Alliance's fight against tyranny. The planet's warrior culture meant that skilled fighters from Ordo could be found on multiple sides of the galactic conflict.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Ordo quickly became part of the new Mandalorian government though its long-term fate remains uncertain as numberous factions covet the Mandalore sector. The planet continued to serve as the homeworld of Clan Ordo, maintaining its traditions and producing warriors who would shape Mandalorian society in the post-Imperial era.\n\nThe Archaic Arsenal remained a vital cultural institution, preserving Mandalorian heritage through the tumultuous changes that swept the galaxy. For members of Clan Ordo and Mandalorians throughout the sector, the Arsenal represented continuity with their warrior past and hope for their future as a people."

920902,Old, "Kalevala is the fourth planet in the Mandalore system, and neighbour to the Mandalorian's homeworld of Mandalore. A toxic desert world, Kalevala is the home of House Kryze, and the birthplace of the late Duchess Satine Kryze, former ruler of the Mandalorian Sector. The planet produces fine wines and rich textiles, and Kalevala Spaceworks manufactures custom luxury spacecraft such as the Nau'ur-class yachts First Light, owned by Dryden Vos, and the Coronet, used by Duchess Satine and her New Mandalorian Government."
920902,New, "Kalevala is a terrestrial world located in the Mandalore system of the Outer Rim Territories, sharing its star with the legendary Mandalorian homeworld. A planet of harsh desert landscapes and toxic atmospheric conditions, Kalevala has nevertheless maintained an important position in Mandalorian society for thousands of years.\n\nThe planet is most notably the ancestral seat of House Kryze, one of the most prominent and influential Mandalorian houses throughout galactic history. The Kryze family maintained their traditional stronghold on Kalevala while wielding considerable political power across the Mandalore sector.\n\nDespite its inhospitable surface conditions, Kalevala developed a sophisticated civilization centered around enclosed cities that protected inhabitants from the toxic atmosphere. The planet became renowned throughout the sector for producing luxury goods, particularly fine wines and rich textiles that were highly sought after by wealthy patrons across the galaxy.\n\nKalevala is also home to Kalevala Spaceworks, a prestigious starship manufacturer specializing in custom luxury spacecraft. The company's designs became synonymous with elegance and refinement, with their vessels serving as status symbols for the galaxy's elite. Most notably, Kalevala Spaceworks produced the Nau'ur-class yacht, vessels that combined exceptional performance with luxurious appointments.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kalevala maintained its position within Mandalorian space while the warrior culture of Mandalore dominated the sector. The planet's focus on refinement and culture sometimes created tensions with more traditionalist Mandalorian clans who emphasized martial prowess above all else.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Kalevala continued its role as a center of Mandalorian culture and commerce. House Kryze wielded significant influence within Mandalorian politics, with family members frequently serving in leadership positions within the sector government.\n\nIn the decades before the Clone Wars, Mandalorian society underwent profound changes as a pacifist movement gained strength. Duchess Satine Kryze of House Kryze, born on Kalevala, became the leader of the New Mandalorians, a faction that rejected the traditional warrior culture and sought to transform Mandalorian society into a peaceful, neutral power.\n\nDuchess Satine's reforms proved controversial, creating deep divisions within Mandalorian society. Traditional warrior clans viewed the pacifist ideology as a betrayal of Mandalorian heritage, while the New Mandalorians argued that their people's violent past had brought nothing but suffering and that a new path was necessary.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Duchess Satine led the New Mandalorian government from Mandalore while maintaining close ties to Kalevala and House Kryze. She utilized a Kalevala Spaceworks vessel, the Coronet, as her personal transport and mobile command center. The luxury yacht served not only as transportation but also as a symbol of the New Mandalorians' commitment to refinement and diplomacy over militarism.\n\nThe Mandalore system, including Kalevala, attempted to maintain neutrality during the Clone Wars, with Duchess Satine refusing to align with either the Galactic Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems. However, the Death Watch, a terrorist organization of traditional Mandalorian warriors, actively opposed Satine's pacifist government and conducted attacks throughout the sector.\n\nApproximately 19 years before the rise of the Empire, the rogue Sith Lord Darth Maul seized control of Mandalore through manipulation of Death Watch and other criminal elements. Maul's forces overthrew Duchess Satine's government, and the Duchess herself was killed by Maul during his occupation of Mandalore. Her death marked the end of the New Mandalorian movement's dominance and the beginning of a darker era for the Mandalore sector.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Kalevala came under Imperial oversight as part of the Empire's control over the Mandalore sector. The Empire recognized the strategic importance of maintaining influence over Mandalorian space, though the fractured nature of Mandalorian society following Satine's death made complete Imperial control difficult to achieve.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Kalevala remained under nominal Imperial control, though various Mandalorian factions operated with varying degrees of independence. The planet's luxury goods industries continued operating, now serving Imperial clients and wealthy Core Worlders who could afford Kalevala's prestigious products.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Kalevala became a core world of the new Mandalorian government as Imperial control over the Mandalore sector weakened. Various Mandalorian factions competed for influence, with the legacy of Duchess Satine and House Kryze remaining significant in debates about Mandalore's future direction and the nature of Mandalorian identity in the post-Imperial era."

The planet's harsh environment discouraged settlement, with only the hardiest colonists attempting to establish outposts on its surface. Most such efforts failed within years, unable to sustain themselves in the unforgiving conditions.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Morellia continued its existence in obscurity.

Anteevy seceded during the Clone Wars, but was later annexed by the Galactic Empire, which created a factory to manufacture specially-modified AT-ATs that could withstand extreme cold."
921202,New, "Anteevy is a terrestrial world located in the Spadja sector of the Mid Rim Territories. A planet of harsh, frozen terrain dominated by icy plains and brutal winter conditions, Anteevy has remained largely isolated from major galactic events throughout most of its history.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Anteevy was discovered during the early expansion of the Galactic Republic. However, the planet's extreme cold and inhospitable environment discouraged extensive colonization, with only small settlements established by hardy colonists willing to brave the perpetual winter.\n\nDuring the Mandalorian Wars, approximately 3,976 years before the rise of the Empire, Anteevy fell under the control of the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders as they swept through the Mid Rim in their campaign of conquest. The Mandalorians occupied the planet for a time, though its limited strategic value and harsh conditions meant they maintained only a modest presence.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Mandalorians, Anteevy was reclaimed by the Galactic Republic. The planet remained a quiet Republic member world for thousands of years, contributing little to galactic affairs beyond serving as a waypoint for vessels traveling through the Mid Rim. The native population adapted to their frozen world, developing technologies and survival techniques suited to the extreme cold.\n\nDuring the Clone Wars, Anteevy seceded from the Republic to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet's motivations for joining the Separatists remain unclear, though the Separatists may have recognized potential military applications for Anteevy's extreme environment. The world remained under Separatist control throughout much of the conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Anteevy was brought under Imperial authority. The Empire recognized the planet's unique environment as ideal for testing and developing specialized military equipment designed to operate in extreme cold conditions. Imperial engineers established facilities on Anteevy to develop cold-weather variants of standard military vehicles.\n\nMost notably, the Empire constructed a factory on Anteevy dedicated to producing modified All Terrain Armored Transport walkers specifically designed to withstand the planet's brutal cold. These specialized AT-ATs featured enhanced insulation, upgraded heating systems, and reinforced components capable of functioning in temperatures that would disable standard models. The Anteevy facility became an important testing ground for Imperial cold-weather military technology.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Anteevy remained under Imperial control. The planet's military production facilities continued operating, supplying specialized equipment for Imperial forces deployed to ice worlds throughout the galaxy. The Empire maintained a garrison to protect the factories and ensure continued production.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Anteevy's status became uncertain. The planet's specialized manufacturing capabilities made it valuable to factions seeking to expand military production capacity. The frigid world continued its existence as a center for cold-weather military technology development in the uncertain post-Imperial era."

921302,Old, "Baros is a remote, arid world in the Outer Rim. Although it was first discovered many thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, it did not attract attention until that government received reports of coded messages being transmitted from its surface. Its reptilian natives, the Brubb, had begun sending those messages after theorizing that other sapient life existed in the galaxy."
921302,New, "Baros is a remote desert world located in the Outer Rim Territories. A planet of arid landscapes, rocky terrain, and harsh conditions, Baros remained largely unknown to galactic civilization for most of its history due to its isolation and lack of strategic value.\n\nThe planet is home to the Brubb, a reptilian species characterized by their distinctive appearance and modest technological development. For thousands of years, the Brubb lived in relative isolation on their desert homeworld, developing their own culture and civilization without contact with the broader galaxy.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Baros was briefly discovered during early Republic exploration efforts. However, the planet's remote location and the Brubb's primitive technology meant it was catalogued but largely ignored. The Republic maintained no presence on Baros, and the world faded from galactic consciousness.\n\nThe Brubb civilization gradually advanced over the millennia, developing increasingly sophisticated technology while remaining unaware that they shared the galaxy with countless other sentient species. Their isolated development meant they progressed at their own pace, shaped entirely by their desert environment and internal cultural evolution.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Baros remained unknown to most galactic powers. The planet's position in the remote Outer Rim and the Brubb's lack of spacefaring capability meant no meaningful contact occurred between Baros and the Republic for thousands of years.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Baros continued its existence in isolation. Neither the Galactic Republic nor the Confederacy of Independent Systems had any knowledge of the planet or its inhabitants, and the Brubb remained unaware of the massive galactic conflict occurring beyond their world.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Baros's status changed dramatically when Imperial scouts detected unusual transmissions emanating from the planet's surface. Investigation revealed that the Brubb had recently developed radio technology and, theorizing that other intelligent life might exist in the galaxy, had begun broadcasting messages into space.\n\nThese transmissions consisted of mathematical formulas, scientific data, and attempts at communication, representing the Brubb's first effort to reach out beyond their world. The messages were encoded in ways the Brubb believed might be universally comprehensible to other intelligent species, should any exist.\n\nImperial authorities recognized the significance of this discovery - a previously unknown sentient species attempting first contact. The Empire dispatched representatives to Baros to make official contact with the Brubb civilization. This first contact proved momentous for the Brubb, who learned they were far from alone in a galaxy teeming with life.\n\nThe Brubb's reaction to discovering the galactic community remains poorly documented in available records. However, the Empire's interest in Baros appeared primarily focused on assessing whether the planet held any strategic or economic value worth exploiting. Finding little of immediate use, the Empire maintained only minimal oversight of the world.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Baros remained largely peripheral to the conflict between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. The planet's remote location and the Brubb's limited technological development meant it attracted minimal attention from either side. The Brubb themselves were likely still processing the implications of discovering they inhabited a galaxy filled with advanced spacefaring civilizations.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Baros's status remained uncertain. The planet represented one of countless worlds in the Outer Rim where the collapse of Imperial authority created political vacuum. Whether the Brubb would seek membership in the New Republic, attempt to maintain independence, or face exploitation by various factions competing for influence in the post-Imperial era remained unclear."

921402,New, "Targonn is a terrestrial world located in the Outer Rim Territories. A planet of mountainous terrain and varied climates, Targonn is the homeworld of the Targonnian species, an avian humanoid race characterized by their distinctive features and insular culture.\n\nFor most of galactic history, Targonn remained isolated from the broader galactic community. The planet's remote location and the Targonnians' preference for independence meant that little was recorded about their world in Republic archives. Unlike many species who sought membership in galactic governments, the Targonnians maintained their sovereignty, never joining the Galactic Republic or any other major power.\n\nThe Targonnian government was led by a hereditary ruler who held the title of ""Dictator-Forever,"" a position passed down through a single family line for generations. This autocratic system concentrated power in the hands of one individual, who governed with absolute authority over all aspects of Targonnian society. The Dictator-Forever ruled from the planetary capital, maintaining strict control over both domestic affairs and any limited contact with offworld visitors.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Targonn appeared on star charts but attracted minimal attention from explorers, traders, or Republic officials. The Targonnians showed little interest in galactic affairs and actively discouraged outsiders from settling on their world. This isolation suited both the ruling dynasty, who feared external influences might threaten their authority, and the general population, who had developed a deeply insular culture over millennia.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Targonn maintained its traditional isolation, refusing to align with either the Galactic Republic or the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The planet's lack of strategic resources or military significance meant neither side showed interest in forcing Targonn into the conflict. The Targonnians continued their existence under the Dictator-Forever's rule, largely unaware of the massive galactic struggle occurring beyond their world.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Targonn remained independent. The Empire showed minimal interest in the remote world, recognizing that the resources required to subjugate and administer Targonn would exceed any potential benefit. The Dictator-Forever maintained power, and the Targonnian population continued their traditional way of life without significant Imperial interference.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Targonn remained neutral and isolated. Neither the Empire nor the Rebel Alliance established any presence on the planet, and the Targonnians showed no inclination to involve themselves in the larger galactic conflict. The planet's mountainous terrain and lack of significant infrastructure made it unsuitable as a military base for either side.\n\nApproximately four years after the Battle of Endor, the long rule of the Dictator-Forever came to an abrupt end. An opposition movement that had been organizing in secret launched a successful revolution, overthrowing the hereditary dictatorship. The opposition forces, led by Targonnians who had been exposed to democratic ideals from offworld, fought to liberate their people from autocratic rule.\n\nThe revolution succeeded in deposing the Dictator-Forever and dismantling the apparatus of absolute power that had governed Targonn for generations. The new government worked to establish more representative institutions, though the exact form these took remained unclear from available records. The transition from dictatorship to a more open system proved challenging for a population that had known only autocratic rule for their entire history.\n\nFollowing the revolution, Targonn began tentatively reaching out to the wider galaxy, though the planet maintained its preference for independence. The Targonnians did not seek membership in the New Republic or align themselves with any major faction, preferring to maintain their sovereignty while gradually opening their world to limited trade and cultural exchange. The planet remained a minor world in the Outer Rim, notable primarily for its successful overthrow of a long-standing dictatorship and its avian inhabitants' continued commitment to independence."

Unlike the structured space of the galactic disk, these systems remain isolated, connected only by unreliable or undiscovered hyperspace routes.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Wild Space served as a buffer zone between known civilization and the true unknown. The difficulty of navigation, combined with sparse resources and dangerous anomalies, discouraged systematic exploration. Only the most desperate colonists or determined explorers ventured into these regions.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Wild Space contained numerous lost colonies, forgotten outposts, and remnants of failed expeditions. Ships that strayed too far from established routes often vanished without trace, their fates becoming cautionary tales for spacers. The Republic maintained minimal presence, occasionally dispatching survey missions that rarely returned with actionable intelligence.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, neither the Republic nor the Separatists showed interest in Wild Space territories. The logistical challenges of projecting power into these regions far exceeded any strategic value they might offer.\n\nFollowing the Empire's rise, Imperial scouts periodically probed Wild Space in search of resources and potential threats. These expeditions met with limited success, though some returned with disturbing reports of anomalous sensor readings and unidentified contacts at extreme range. The Empire classified most such reports, dismissing them as equipment malfunctions or spacer superstition.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Wild Space offered refuge for those seeking to disappear. Rebel cells occasionally established temporary bases in Wild Space systems, though supply difficulties and isolation made long-term operations impractical. Criminal organizations used Wild Space as hideouts and smuggling waypoints, though even pirates approached these regions with caution.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Wild Space remained as mysterious and dangerous as ever. The few explorers who ventured into its depths spoke of strange phenomena: sectors where hyperspace behaved unpredictably, abandoned structures of unknown origin, and fleeting contacts that vanished before proper identification. Some whispered of things moving in the darkness between stars, though most dismissed such tales as the inevitable result of too much time in deep space."

921602,Old, "Many strange and dangerous things may be found out beyond the farthest reaches of known space. Few explorers venture this far out, and fewer still return."
921602,New, "This sector lies at the very edge of Wild Space, where the last fragments of galactic civilization give way to true isolation. Navigation becomes increasingly unreliable as hyperspace routes fragment and disappear, leaving only the most primitive point-to-point jumps possible.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, this region appeared on charts as blank space, marked only with warnings about navigation hazards. The few survey missions dispatched here either found nothing of value or failed to return, their disappearances attributed to natural phenomena or equipment failure.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, this sector remained completely isolated from the galactic conflict. Neither Republic nor Separatist forces ventured into regions so remote and hazardous, focusing instead on strategic systems closer to established territories.\n\nFollowing the Empire's rise, Imperial exploration programs occasionally probed the sector's boundaries. Scouts reported unusual sensor anomalies and gravitational distortions inconsistent with known stellar phenomena. Most expeditions terminated early due to equipment malfunctions or crew reports of psychological stress.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, a handful of desperate smugglers attempted to use this sector as a transit route, seeking to avoid Imperial patrols by cutting through Wild Space. Few completed their journeys. Those who did spoke reluctantly of their experiences, describing long-range contacts that shouldn't exist and hyperjumps that took longer than navigation computers predicted.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, the sector remained avoided by all but the most foolhardy or desperate. Navigation beacons deployed by exploration teams mysteriously failed or transmitted corrupted data. Automated probes sent into the region occasionally returned with recordings showing phenomena their designers never anticipated.\n\nSpacers who operate near Wild Space's edge share stories among themselves, though rarely with outsiders. They speak of debris fields containing wreckage of unfamiliar design, of sensors detecting massive power signatures that vanish upon investigation, of navigation computers plotting courses to destinations that don't appear on any chart. Most dismiss these tales as typical spacer mythology, the inevitable exaggerations of those who spend too long away from civilization.\n\nYet the disappearances continue, and the anomalous readings persist. Whatever lies beyond the edge of known space, it remains a mystery that few dare investigate, and fewer still survive to explain."

A remote system of multiple inhabited worlds, Renatasia remained isolated from galactic civilization for much of its history, developing independently of the major powers that shaped the galaxy.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Renatasia was settled by colonists from the Core Worlds during the early expansion of the Galactic Republic. However, the system's extreme isolation in the Outer Rim meant it lost contact with the Republic shortly after colonization. Cut off from resupply and communication, the Renatasia colonists were left to fend for themselves.\n\nOver millennia of isolation, the descendants of the original colonists developed their own distinct cultures across the system's various inhabited worlds. Without contact with the broader galaxy, they forgot their origins and believed themselves to be alone in the universe. The system's worlds developed independently, with some advancing technologically while others regressed or stagnated.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Renatasia remained completely unknown to galactic civilization. The system's location kept it isolated even from the most adventurous Republic explorers, and no contact was made with the Renatasia colonies for thousands of years. The inhabitants continued their existence in complete ignorance of the vast galactic community beyond their system.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Renatasia remained in isolation, its inhabitants unaware of the massive galactic conflict occurring beyond their borders. The system's worlds continued their independent development, maintaining whatever technological and social progress they had achieved over their long isolation.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Renatasia was rediscovered by scouts from the Centrality, a corporate-controlled region of space in the Outer Rim. The Centrality recognized Renatasia's potential value and reported the system's existence to Imperial authorities, who showed interest in bringing these lost colonies under Imperial control.\n\nImperial Intelligence began covert operations in the Renatasia system, working to assess the system's worlds and their inhabitants. The Empire recognized that direct military conquest would be costly and potentially provoke resistance, so they opted for a more subtle approach involving infiltration and political manipulation.\n\nImperial agents worked to unify the various governments across Renatasia's inhabited worlds, using diplomacy, bribery, and coercion to bring the system's disparate factions under a single administrative structure. This process took considerable time and resources, but eventually succeeded in creating a unified Renatasia government that could be more easily controlled.\n\nOnce this unified government was established, Imperial forces moved openly into the system, presenting themselves as representatives of the galactic community and offering membership in the Galactic Empire. The Renatasia government, manipulated by Imperial agents and lacking knowledge of the Empire's true nature, agreed to join.\n\nRenatasia was formally subjugated by the Empire and incorporated into Imperial territory. The system's worlds, which had existed in isolation for thousands of years, suddenly found themselves part of a galactic empire spanning countless star systems. This transition proved shocking for many inhabitants, who struggled to comprehend the scope of galactic civilization.\n\nThe Empire established garrisons throughout the Renatasia system and began exploiting its resources for Imperial benefit. The system's long isolation meant it possessed unique resources and potentially valuable knowledge that had developed independently of mainstream galactic science and technology. Imperial authorities worked to catalog and exploit these assets.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Renatasia remained under Imperial control. The system's isolation and recent incorporation into galactic civilization meant its inhabitants had little knowledge of or involvement in the larger conflict between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. Most Renatasia colonists remained focused on adapting to their new circumstances as part of galactic society.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Renatasia's status became uncertain. The system's remote location and recent incorporation meant it lacked strong ties to either Imperial remnant factions or the New Republic.

A planet of perpetual ice and snow, with temperatures rarely rising above freezing, Rothana remained largely unknown to galactic civilization for most of its history due to its extreme isolation and inhospitable conditions.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Rothana was discovered by scouts during early Republic exploration efforts. However, the planet's harsh environment and remote location discouraged colonization, and it remained uninhabited for millennia.\n\nApproximately several decades before the Clone Wars, Kuat Drive Yards acquired the rights to Rothana's system coordinates from the original scouts. Recognizing the planet's value as a secure location far from Core Worlds scrutiny, KDY invested substantial resources in developing industrial infrastructure on the frozen world.\n\nKuat Drive Yards established Rothana Heavy Engineering as a subsidiary company headquartered on the planet. The corporation constructed massive factories, shipyards, and research facilities beneath Rothana's ice, creating a hidden industrial complex capable of producing military hardware on a massive scale. The extreme secrecy surrounding these operations meant that even KDY's own vessels were not provided with Rothana's coordinates.\n\nDuring the final years of the Galactic Republic, Rothana Heavy Engineering became a crucial supplier for the Grand Army of the Republic. The company produced specialized military equipment including the Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry gunship, commonly known as the LAAT/i gunship. These versatile craft became essential to Republic military operations, serving as troop transports, close air support platforms, and medical evacuation vehicles throughout the Clone Wars.\n\nRothana Heavy Engineering also manufactured the Acclamator-class assault ship, one of the Republic Navy's primary capital vessels during the Clone Wars. These wedge-shaped warships served as troop carriers and assault craft, capable of deploying thousands of clone troopers and their equipment directly into combat zones. The Rothana shipyards produced these vessels in substantial numbers, contributing significantly to the Republic's military strength.\n\nThe planet's isolation proved advantageous during the Clone Wars, as Separatist intelligence never discovered Rothana's location. The continued secrecy allowed Rothana Heavy Engineering to operate without fear of enemy attack, maintaining steady production of military equipment throughout the conflict.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Rothana came under Imperial control. The Empire recognized the strategic value of Rothana Heavy Engineering's facilities and continued utilizing the planet for military production. However, Imperial oversight meant that Rothana lost some of the autonomy it had enjoyed under the Republic.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Rothana remained under Imperial control throughout most of the conflict. The planet's shipyards continued producing vessels for the Imperial military, though production levels gradually declined as the Empire redirected resources to other projects. The Empire maintained strict security around Rothana, ensuring its location remained classified.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the Emperor's death, Rothana's status became uncertain. The planet's remote location and continued secrecy meant that various Imperial remnant factions competed for control of its valuable industrial facilities. Rothana Heavy Engineering continued operating under whoever controlled the system, adapting to the changing political landscape of the post-Imperial era while maintaining the security protocols that had protected the planet for decades."

921902,Old, "Roon is a legendary world located deep in the Outer Rim Territories. Hidden within a cosmic dust cloud referred to as the Cloak of the Sith, easily-navigable hyperspace routes to Roon had long been lost, leading to high demand for native crystals called Roonstones.\n It is believed that the world was visited and settled by the ancient Taung species, after their exodus from Coruscant. Seven thousand years before the rise of the Empire, the Taung abandoned Roon and emigrated to the world that would come to be called Mandalore. Later inhabitants arrived to the world six thousand years later, close to the end of the New Sith Wars."
921902,New, "Roon is a remote terrestrial world located deep in the Outer Rim Territories, hidden within a dense cosmic dust cloud known as the Cloak of the Sith. This natural phenomenon, combined with unstable hyperspace routes, kept Roon isolated from the broader galaxy for much of its history.\n\nThousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, Roon was discovered and settled by colonists seeking to exploit its natural resources. The planet became known for producing Roonstones, rare crystals with unique properties that made them valuable throughout the galaxy. However, the difficulty of reaching Roon through the Cloak of the Sith meant that trade remained limited and sporadic.\n\nDuring the Old Republic era, Roon maintained a modest presence as a frontier world. The planet's isolation discouraged large-scale colonization, though small settlements persisted in exploiting its mineral wealth. The inhabitants developed a reputation for independence and self-reliance, necessary traits for survival on such a remote world.\n\nThroughout the Clone Wars, Roon's extreme isolation kept it far from the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Neither side showed interest in the remote world, and Roon continued its existence largely unaware of the massive galactic struggle occurring beyond the Cloak of the Sith.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Roon came under nominal Imperial authority, though the Empire maintained minimal presence due to the planet's isolation and limited strategic value. The difficulty of navigating to Roon meant that Imperial oversight remained sporadic at best.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Roon briefly gained significance when both the Empire and the Rebel Alliance became aware of ancient treasures reportedly hidden on the planet. However, the challenges of reaching Roon and the questionable nature of these rumors meant neither side committed substantial resources to exploring these claims.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, Roon remained an isolated frontier world. The planet's position within the Cloak of the Sith continued to discourage regular traffic, and it maintained its character as one of the Outer Rim's most remote and mysterious worlds."

922002,Old, "Gaulus is a terrestrial world in the Outer Rim. The Rebel Alliance once used this world as a base of operations, though they were eventually forced to retreat and escape from the Empire."
922002,New, "Gaulus is a terrestrial planet located in the Outer Rim Territories. The world is notable for its remote location and harsh environment, which includes rocky terrain and limited resources. Gaulus remained largely isolated from galactic affairs for much of its history, with few settlements and minimal development.\n\nDuring the era of the Galactic Empire, Gaulus was used as a base by the Rebel Alliance. The planet's remoteness made it an ideal location for covert operations and refuge from Imperial patrols. Rebel forces established hidden facilities on Gaulus, conducting missions and coordinating activities in the surrounding sectors.\n\nThe Empire eventually discovered the Rebel presence on Gaulus and launched an assault to eliminate the base. Imperial forces attacked the planet, forcing the Rebels to evacuate and abandon their operations there. The loss of Gaulus as a base was a setback for the Alliance, but they continued their struggle against the Empire elsewhere in the galaxy.\n\nFollowing the evacuation, Gaulus returned to its status as a remote and sparsely populated world. The planet remained largely forgotten."

922102,Old, "Lasan is a planet located in Wild Space that served as a secondary homeworld to the Lasat species, following the loss of contact with their original world, Lira San. When the Galactic Empire established its rule over the galaxy, Lasan resisted and challenged Imperial dominance, leading the Empire to invade the planet and attempt to exterminate the Lasat people.\n The commander of the siege, Alexandr Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau, later defected and joined the Rebellion, fighting alongside one of the Lasat survivors, Garazeb Orrelios."
922102,New, "Lasan is a terrestrial planet located in the Outer Rim's Wild Space region, serving as the homeworld of the Lasat species. The planet's surface features rugged terrain, including rocky highlands, deep canyons, and scattered forests. Lasan's climate is temperate, supporting a variety of native flora and fauna adapted to its mountainous environment.\n\nThe Lasat are a tall, muscular humanoid species known for their strength, agility, and distinctive facial features. Lasan's society was organized around clans and a monarchy, with the Lasan High Honor Guard serving as both ceremonial protectors and elite warriors. The Honor Guard was renowned for its skill in combat and its use of the bo-rifle, a traditional weapon unique to Lasat culture.\n\nFor centuries, Lasan remained isolated from the broader galaxy, developing its own customs and traditions. The Lasat valued honor, loyalty, and community, with their culture emphasizing respect for elders and the importance of clan ties. Lasan's cities and settlements were built to blend with the planet's natural landscape, reflecting the species' connection to their environment.\n\nDuring the final years of the Galactic Republic, Lasan maintained limited contact with galactic civilization. The planet's remote location and lack of strategic resources meant it attracted little attention from major powers. However, Lasan's skilled warriors occasionally served as mercenaries or bodyguards for offworld clients, earning the species a reputation for reliability and discipline.\n\nFollowing the rise of the Galactic Empire, Lasan's fate changed dramatically. The Empire, seeking to expand its control over Wild Space and suppress potential resistance, launched a brutal campaign against the planet. Imperial forces invaded Lasan, targeting the Lasat population and attempting to eradicate their culture. The Honor Guard fought valiantly to defend their world, but the Empire's superior numbers and advanced weaponry proved overwhelming.\n\nThe Imperial assault devastated Lasan. Cities were destroyed, and much of the Lasat population was killed or enslaved. Survivors were scattered across the galaxy, with some finding refuge on distant worlds or among sympathetic communities. The destruction of Lasan became a symbol of Imperial oppression and the loss suffered by countless species during the Empire's reign.\n\nDespite the tragedy, the Lasat people endured. Survivors maintained their traditions and continued to honor their heritage, passing down stories of Lasan and the Honor Guard to future generations. The memory of their homeworld remained central to Lasat identity, inspiring hope that one day their people might return and rebuild.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor, Lasan remained a devastated world, its cities in ruins and its population dispersed. The planet's legacy lived on through the Lasat diaspora, who preserved their culture and remembered the sacrifices made in defense of their home."
