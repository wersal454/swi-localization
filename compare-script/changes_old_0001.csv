800309,Old, "In a bold move signalling the start of a new arms race, various factions across the galaxy have commenced the construction of new Super Star Destroyers and Dreadnaughts. This escalation follows a recent surge in interstellar tensions, with rivalries heating up between the New Republic, Ascendancy, remnants of the Galactic Empire and other emerging powers. .\n\nThe arms race has sparked concerns among neutral systems and smaller factions, fearing they might be caught in the crossfire between galactic superpowers. Diplomatic efforts are underway, but the galaxy watches with bated breath as the race for military dominance accelerates. As construction continues, the balance of power in the galaxy hangs in the balance, with the potential for significant repercussions in the years to come."

903602,Old, "Corellia is a planet in the Core Worlds, located along the Corellian Run and Corellian Trade Spine hyperspace routes. Known for its shipbuilding industry, Corellia is the homeworld of the Corellian Engineering Corporation, which produces some of the galaxy's most iconic starships, including the YT-series freighters and CR90 corvettes.\n\nThe planet's surface features sprawling cities such as Coronet City, vast shipyards, and temperate landscapes with forests, plains, and oceans. Corellians are renowned for their piloting skills, independence, and adventurous spirit, with many famous smugglers and heroes, including Han Solo, originating from the world.\n\nCorellia was a founding member of the Galactic Republic and played a significant role in galactic politics and commerce for millennia. During the Clone Wars, Corellia remained loyal to the Republic, though its leadership maintained a degree of autonomy and neutrality in some galactic affairs. The planet's shipyards contributed to the Republic war effort, and Corellian Security Force \(CorSec\) maintained order locally.\n\nAfter the rise of the Galactic Empire, Corellia came under Imperial control. The Empire expanded ship production and maintained a strong military presence, though Corellians continued to value their independence. The planet's shipyards produced vessels for the Imperial Navy, and Imperial rule brought increased regulation and surveillance.\n\nDuring the Galactic Civil War, Corellia remained under Imperial authority, but many Corellians secretly supported the Rebel Alliance. The planet's strategic location and shipbuilding capacity made it a valuable asset for both the Empire and the Rebellion. Han Solo, a native Corellian, became a key figure in the Rebellion and the fight against the Empire.\n\nAfter the Battle of Endor and the fall of the Empire, Corellia joined the New Republic. The planet continued to serve as a major commercial and industrial center, maintaining its reputation for producing skilled pilots and advanced starships. Corellia's independent spirit persisted, and its citizens played important roles in the rebuilding of galactic government and society."
