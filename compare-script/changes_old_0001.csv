103730,Old, "Developed alongside the TIE Defender, the TIE Fury was an early concept bid for an Imperial TIE heavy fighter. With the success of the Defender, the Fury’s development was mothballed and it never left its prototype test phase. Despite being heavily armed with four ion cannons, two laser cannons, and four ordinance launchers, the Fury was regarded as a failure due to its low speeds and low maneuverability. Coupled with a higher production cost than even the TIE Defender, it was deemed impractical to utilize the TIE Fury even in specialized roles.\n\nDeep Space traders have reported seeing ships matching the TIE Fury, though these reports remain unverified. The Corporate Sector Authority, Galactic Empire, and New Republic have issued warnings to traders traveling near the Stenos system, and urges any ship that detects unidentified vessels to withdraw from the area immediately."
