100930,Old, "The TIE/IN starfighter, simply known as the TIE Interceptor or T/I, was a TIE Series starfighter used by the Galactic Empire. The TIE Interceptor was identifiable by its arrow-shaped solar collection panels, a distinct difference from the hexagonal solar arrays of its predecessor, the TIE Fighter.\n\nThe Interceptor was one of the fastest starfighters in the galaxy at its prime, nearly rivalling the Alliance's RZ-1 A-wing interceptor.\nDue to their speed, distinct shape, and narrow profile in comparison to the TIE/ln starfighter (which was nicknamed ""eyeball""), TIE Interceptors came to be referred to occasionally as ""squints"" by enemy pilots.\n\nThis is a late modification outfitted with a shield generator."

These units were often dispatched by various space navies to gather information from a variety of different locations, reporting anything of significance as defined by specific preprogrammed protocols."

Dating back to the founding of the Galactic Republic, Rendili is synonymous with starship construction, and prides itself on efficiency and reliability over cutting-edge innovation.\n\nRSD's ships served as the backbone of the Republic's navy and planetary defence fleets for millennia, including famed (and infamous) designs such as the Dreadnought-class Heavy Cruiser.\n\nIn the final centuries of the Galactic Republic, Rendili's prominence waned as its rival, Kuat Drive Yards, gained influence."

800309,Old, "In a bold move signalling the start of a new arms race, various factions across the galaxy have commenced the construction of new Super Star Destroyers and Dreadnaughts. This escalation follows a recent surge in interstellar tensions, with rivalries heating up between the New Republic, Ascendancy, remnants of the Galactic Empire and other emerging powers. .\n\nThe arms race has sparked concerns among neutral systems and smaller factions, fearing they might be caught in the crossfire between galactic superpowers. Diplomatic efforts are underway, but the galaxy watches with bated breath as the race for military dominance accelerates. As construction continues, the balance of power in the galaxy hangs in the balance, with the potential for significant repercussions in the years to come."
