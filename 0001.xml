			<t id="100920">TIE/IN</t>
			<t id="100930">The TIE/IN starfighter, simply known as the TIE Interceptor or T/I, was a TIE Series starfighter used by the Galactic Empire. The TIE Interceptor was identifiable by its arrow-shaped solar collection panels, a distinct difference from the hexagonal solar arrays of its predecessor, the TIE Fighter. The Interceptor was one of the fastest starfighters in the galaxy at its prime, nearly rivalling the Alliance's RZ-1 A-wing interceptor. Due to their speed, distinct shape, and narrow profile in comparison to the TIE/ln starfighter (which was nicknamed "eyeball"), TIE Interceptors came to be referred to occasionally as "squints" by enemy pilots. This is a late modification outfitted with a shield generator.</t>

			<t id="101010">TIE Advanced</t>
			<t id="101020">TIE/x1</t>
			<t id="101030">Part of a line of experimental models based on the TIE series, Sienar Fleet Systems'  TIE/x1, most commonly referred to as the TIE Advanced, came standard with both a hyperdrive and shield deflectors. While the Advanced model was never put into full-scale production, many Imperial ace pilots were known to choose it as their fighter of choice. One well known-- and greatly feared-- pilot was Darth Vader himself, who personally customised his TIE-x1 to suit his flying skills. </t>

			<t id="101110">TIE Defender</t>
			<t id="101120">TIE/D</t>
			<t id="101130">The TIE/D Defender, commonly known as the TIE Defender or T/D, was a high-performance TIE Series starfighter developed for the Imperial Navy by Sienar Fleet Systems in a project overseen by Grand Admiral Demetrius Zaarin shortly before the Battle of Endor. Representing a shift in starfighter design from previous TIE models, the ship featured a hyperdrive as well as deflector shields to allow it to operate independently of Imperial capital ships. The ship's speed and agility, combined with its arsenal of four laser cannons, two ion cannons and two warhead launchers made it arguably the most advanced starfighter available at the time.</t>

			<t id="110030">The GR-75 Medium Transport, also known as the Gallofree medium transport, is a starship originally produced by Gallofree Yards, Inc. Its outer hull is a lightly armoured hollow shell, with the interior entirely open for cargo pods. While used in Rebel Alliance fleets against the Galactic Empire, its light armament and armour prohibited it from being used as a frontline warship. Instead, they typically remained in the rearguard of fleets. Due to their modular design, they were often used as supply ships, troop transports, and communications vessels.\n\nSeveral GR-75 transports famously participated in the evacuation of Rebel forces at the Battle of Hoth.</t>
			<t id="110031">Based on Gallofree Shipyard's GR-75, the GR-75 Battle Refit exchanges cargo capacity for additional weapons, armour and shielding. While the modifications improve its combat capabilities, the Battle Refit can't compete against dedicated combat vessels. This variant saw more use as a support ship in small convoys, or as a security vessel for private corporations and planetary governments.</t>

The resulting ship, the Acclamator-II, sacrificed most of the original Acclamator's cargo space for additional weaponry and shielding, and was used by the Republic to carry out orbital bombardments during the Clone Wars. Following the end of that conflict, the Acclamator-II was retired by the Galactic Empire, and now sees service within the fleets of the Corporate Sector Authority.</t>

In the years following the war, the Empire retired the majority of these ships. Many years later, as the Galactic Civil War began, several Pelta-class frigates fell into the hands of Rebel forces, which modified them for greater firepower at the cost of cargo storage. Eventually, the New Republic found the modified Pelta frigates to be efficient enough that the modifications were formalized under the Pelta-II designation.</t>

			<t id="130330">The Venator-class Star Destroyer was the backbone of the Galactic Republic's naval forces during the Clone Wars. As the first of the Star Destroyers designed by Kuat Drive Yards, the Venator combined high firepower with a substantial starfighter complement, and often served as a command ship for Jedi generals. Capable of quickly fielding dozens of fighters, the Venator is purpose-built as a carrier first and warship second. While it may not be able to hold its own against some ships of comparable size by itself, the fighters and other support craft it houses can turn the tide of battle.\n\nFollowing the end of the Clone Wars, the Venator was slowly retired in favour of the Imperial-class Star Destroyer, and scrapped or sold as surplus to a wide variety of corporate and private interests.\n\nThis iteration of the Venator is seen among Corporate Sector fleets, and has been modernised with additional shielding and hull reinforcements, which came at the cost of some of its fighter capacity.</t>

			<t id="130620">Neutron Star Builder</t>
			<t id="130630">The Neutron Star Bulk Cruiser was designed by Rendili StarDrive as a second-line warship for the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars. However, it was already obsolete by the time it was produced, and the defeat of the Separatists meant the Neutron Star never saw combat. Rejected by the Empire, Rendili sold the ship to private interests as patrol vessels in poor sectors and fringe systems.\n\nThis model has been converted into a construction vessel, sacrificing heavy armaments for a reinforced hull and the ability to assemble stations.</t>

			<t id="132020">Bellator</t>
			<t id="132030">The Bellator-class Dreadnaught is a divergent design in the Mandator-series of Star Dreadnaught that served as a warship in the Imperial Navy. It is a class of large-scale dreadnaught that was manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards and served as a flagship in numerous Imperial fleets across the galaxy during the reign of Emperor Palpatine. Thanks to recent conflicts, a shortage of materials and manpower, and the destruction or capture of key shipyards, few Bellators remain in service.</t>

In the ongoing conflict between the Corporate Sector Authority and the Independent Commerce Guild, new ship designs have begun appearing as evolutions of decades-old warfare.\nThe Allocator is a newer design in the Commerce Guild fleet, with a focus on direct ship-to-ship firepower developed specifically to fight similarly new threats from the Corporate Sector.</t>

			<t id="132410">MC85 Star Cruiser</t>
			<t id="132420">MC85</t>
			<t id="132430">Following the Battle of Endor and the formation of the New Republic, the Mon Calamari Shipyards and Corellian Engineering Corporation cooperated to develop a new frontline warship for a multi-species navy.  The resulting ship, the MC85 Star Cruiser, is a massive battleship intended to be a defensive keystone in New Republic fleets. Rather than being a repurposed civilian ship, like the MC80 line, the MC85 was designed from the start to engage in direct ship-to-ship combat.\n\nA robust and sturdy platform, this cruiser utilizes heavy weaponry and advanced shielding. Keeping with the New Republic doctrine of force projection through versatility, the MC85 also boasts large inset hangars, allowing it to carry a full complement of fighters.</t>

			<t id="132510">Subjugator Battle Cruiser</t>
			<t id="132520">Subjugator</t>
			<t id="132530">In the early months of the Clone Wars, the Republic Navy was plagued by a new and terrifying threat:  a Subjugator-class Battlecruiser, the Malevolence. Initially the Republic had difficulty in tracking the Malevolence as its advanced axial Ion Cannons were capable of projecting a massive blast which disabled any vessel caught in its wake, and even entire fleets of Republic Star Destroyers fell to the following barrage of missiles and laser fire. The Republic's first several encounters with the Malevolence resulted in a complete loss of Republic assets, and only a handful of survivors. However, with the intelligence acquired by those survivors, Republic forces under General Anakin Skywalker were able to disable the Malevolence with a large-scale bomber strike, and on-board sabotage forced the ship to crash into the Dead Moon of Antar, finally destroying it.\n\nDespite being wildly successful in its first engagements, the Separatists kept their remaining Subjugators away from the frontlines except as a last result, fearing additional losses of these resource-intensive ships; those remaining Subjugators disappeared entirely after the Clone Wars. Following the end of the Galactic Civil War, and the growing hostilities between the Corporate Sector Authority and Independent Commerce Guild, it has been rumored that these massive ships have once again been seen in supermassive shipyards.</t>

			<t id="500130">The Galactic Empire, also known as the New Order, or simply the Empire, was the galactic government that replaced the Galactic Republic in the aftermath of the Clone Wars. The Empire ushered galactic civilisation into a new age of safety, freedom, justice, and security, but this was achieved through absolute tyranny. Shortly before the Battle of Yavin, less than twenty years after its founding, the Empire had its legislative body, the Galactic Senate, dissolved, effectively becoming a military dictatorship. It is currently the largest political, territorial, and military power to date, with access to nearly unlimited funding and holding sway over a large majority of the galaxy. However, following the death of its Emperor, Sheev Palpatine, during the disastrous Battle of Endor, the Empire has entered a period of steady decline over the past few years, with some political or military groups within the Empire breaking away entirely, either to continue the Imperial dream on their own terms or to form new dominions. Those still loyal to the Imperial leadership are known by Alliance intelligence officers as simply Imperial Loyalists. As of 4 ABY, the Empire is lead by a Grand Vizier, originally a title held by the Emperor's personal assistant. The current Grand Vizier is Sate Pestage. </t>

Eschewing certain Imperial traditions, the Ascendancy has replaced some ships with less popular designs, and uses the Anoat Federation, a vassal state of pirates, mercenaries, and smugglers, to harass the New Republic.\nAs a consequence of Imperial ideology, the Ascendancy despises its rival in the north.</t>

			<t id="509120">ANO</t>
			<t id="509130">Once a small mining corporation based in Anoat system, the Anoat Federation is a growing power thanks to Imperial Ascendancy investments. These investments began as a means to use the Federation as a proxy for activities the Imperial Ascendancy found unsavoury, such as criminal and smuggling operations. They have since grown to include legitimate business and logistics operations within Anoat space, all to serve Ascendancy goals. It is safe to call Anoat Federation a vassal of the Imperial Ascendancy, which causes significant friction with the New Republic.</t>

It wields significant influence in various galactic governments and is heavily involved in piracy and smuggling.\nFormed at the end of the Great Galactic War, more than three thousand years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, the Black Sun quickly rose to prominence by seizing control of neighbourhoods in the lower levels of Coruscant. Throughout the next few years, the organisation spread beyond the planet and became a galactic criminal syndicate.\nIn addition to its activities in "regular" organised crime, the Black Sun's true reach included an intelligence network that rivalled even that of the Galactic Empire, and the syndicate even employed its own private army and assassins.</t>

Based in orbital yards around the planet Kuat, the company and its subsidiaries have manufactured everything from swoop bikes to the mighty Imperial-class Star Destroyer. \n Formed by a union of aristocrats known as the Ten, Kuat Drive Yards has faced significant opposition over its long history. From internal strife during the construction of the shipyards, to competition with larger corporations like Core Galaxy Systems and Hoersch-Kessel Drive, Inc, KDY initially struggled to survive in a harsh and competitive environment. It has earned a reputation as a predatory company, buying up smaller shipbuilders and operating outside the Kuat sector to earn its place. \n In the Clone Wars, Kuat sold vehicles and vessels to the Republic, including the mighty Venator-class Star Destroyer. During the Imperial Era, Kuat manufactured the Imperial-class Star Destroyers and the All-Terrain series of walkers.</t>

Operating out of the orbital shipyards of Mon Calamari, MCS is renowned for its elegant, organic-looking hulls. \n Formed more than four thousand years before the formation of the Galactic Empire, Mon Calamari Shipyards was a collaborative effort between the two native species of Mon Calamari: The Mon Calamari and the Quarren. Dreaming of what lay beyond their oceanic world, the company developed several orbital facilities to construct starliners and specialised exploration vessels. \n After the formation of the Galactic Empire, the company and its home planet were subjugated and enslaved, though the Imperials never managed to adapt Mon Calamari technology to Imperial standards. Mon Calamari Shipyards were still able to develop luxury starliners, however, and the company took advantage of this to secretly produce prototypes for warships. Eventually, Mon Calamari overthrew Imperial occupation and used its orbital shipyards to retrofit its luxury liners into the infamous MC-series of star cruisers.\n\nThis corporation will not change alignment when captured!</t>

Our Guild operates in all major government jurisdictions, but main office is in Milagro system. \n\nWe do offer variety of targets and unique ships for your needs, if you buy that license that is.\n</t>

			<t id="800110">Head of Logistics</t>
			<t id="800111">It is time for maintenance!</t>
			<t id="800112">Attention Citizen!\n\nBy galactic law and common sense you will now have to pay more attention to your ships as they require regular maintenance. There are a few ways to make your life easier, so pay attention! \n NOTE: The Maintenance menu can be accessed through the player info menu-- look for a wrench icon!\n\nHOW THE MAINTENANCE SYSTEM WORKS\n1. The maintenance cycle occurs every 30 minutes, and the Maintenance menu will display the time until the next cycle.\n2. The SHIP SUPPLIES ware can be bought from other factions, or produced yourself with a Ship Supplies Module, and stored at your Equipment Docks to be consumed.\n3.Each ship has a SUPPLY COST. The more powerful your faction is, the higher that cost. Initially, you will barely notice it, but with further development of your organisation this may change.\nNOTE: The SUPPLY COST of a specific ship can be seen in its encyclopedia entry.\n4.Each sector you own has a SUPPLY LEVEL which negates the SUPPLY COST of your ships. \n5.You can build Equipment Docks in your owned sectors to increase the SUPPLY LEVEL of that sector up to 3 times! Each size of maintenance module, S/M, L, and XL, adds 1 to that multiplier. Multiple modules of the same size are NOT cumulative, so one of each per sector is enough.\nNOTE: Only one EQ dock per sector is considered, and it should not have shipbuilding functionality-- SUCH STATIONS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED! Equipment Docks may have ware production and Administration modules, so you can combine your Ship Module production and your maintenance docks, or your defence stations and maintenance docks, or both!\n6. L/XL ships docked at player-owned EQ Docks will receive a 25% cut in their Supply Cost, regardless of if that EQ Dock is in a player-owned sector.\n7. S/M ships docked at player-owned Carriers and Auxiliary ships will receive a 25% cut in their supply cost, regardless of where the Carrier is.\n8. If the sum of SUPPLY LEVEL from your owned sectors and EQ docks is still not enough to cover your ships cumulative SUPPLY COST, then SHIP SUPPLIES wares will be consumed randomly from all of your EQ docks across the galaxy, usually 2 wares per 1 non-covered SUPPLY COST.\nNOTE:  SHIP SUPPLIES can be consumed from any of your Equipment Docks, though only EQ docks in your owned sectors will increase your SUPPLY LEVEL.\n9.If consuming SUPPLY WARES is still not enough to cover all SUPPLY COST of your ships, then you will pay in money, usually 5000 Credits per 1 non-covered SUPPLY COST. \n\nFailing to pay the maintenance of your ships, which includes wages to your hired crewmen, will lead to morale loss among them.</t>

			<t id="800307">According to latest reports, the New Republic Senate is gathering to discuss the possible violation of the Bespin Treaty signed between the New Republic and the Anoat Federation. \nThe Senate states that the Anoat Federation is allowed to operate in Outer Rim territories only while keeping to agreed territory claims when the treaty at Bespin was signed by the two parties.\nLately, Anoat Federation has been accused numerous times by New Republic representatives of working with the Imperial Ascendancy and various pirate groups, supplying them with ships and weapons.\nThe Anoat Federation may see further deterioration of relations with the New Republic if its expansion continues.</t>

			<t id="800308">New Arms Race!</t>
			<t id="800309">In a bold move signalling the start of a new arms race, various factions across the galaxy have commenced the construction of new Super Star Destroyers and Dreadnaughts. This escalation follows a recent surge in interstellar tensions, with rivalries heating up between the New Republic, Ascendancy, remnants of the Galactic Empire and other emerging powers. .\n\nThe arms race has sparked concerns among neutral systems and smaller factions, fearing they might be caught in the crossfire between galactic superpowers. Diplomatic efforts are underway, but the galaxy watches with bated breath as the race for military dominance accelerates. As construction continues, the balance of power in the galaxy hangs in the balance, with the potential for significant repercussions in the years to come.</t>

After the war, the Republic chose Telos to be the prototype of a project to restore war-ravaged worlds. Despite sabotage by the Czerka Corp, and an attack by the Sith Triumvirate, the project was eventually successful, seeding the world with life from all across the galaxy and restoring Telos to a prosperous beacon for the Republic. In the waning century of the Galactic Republic, famine ravaged the world, leading the governor, Crion, to covertly attempt to conquer a neighbouring world. His son Xanatos, a Jedi Knight, was sent to mediate between the two worlds, but he sided with governor Crion. Xanatos' padawan, Qui-gon Jinn, revealed the plot to the people of Telos, who rose against governor Crion. Following his death at Jinn's hands, Xanatos secretly manipulated the Telosian people into becoming more aggressive and warlike, and exploited the planet's natural resources into desolation. Xanatos committed suicide rather than be arrested. In the Clone Wars, Telos fell within Separatist-controlled space.

			<t id="918701">Unknown Region 3</t>
			<t id="918702">Star systems and general expeditions in the Unknown Regions are considered uneconomical by most recognised governments. However, pirates and a few nameless privateers look forward to find an undiscovered race to be raided upon, or to make mutually beneficial trade partnerships with, respectively.\nThis system is considered to be one of the 'outermost' systems with pre-calculated Jump Routes leading to it. Formerly frequented by pirates and criminals, it was abandoned because of the extreme dangers of being far from any reinforcements in case of an attack by unspecified parties.</t>

			<t id="919402">Voss is a terrestrial world in the Outer Rim. Originally having a single sentient species, the Gormak, the planet was discovered by the ancient Sith, who sought to exploit its natural resources. The Jedi who followed the Sith to Voss taught some of the Gormak tribes to use the Force, but this teaching led to a rapid evolutionary change in those tribes, creating a new species which called itself the Voss. After the Sith on the planet were exterminated and the Jedi left or died out, the planet Voss was forgotten by the galactic community for millennia, until its rediscovery after the Great Galactic War. Despite its neutrality during the Cold War, it served as a battleground between the Old Republic and the True Sith Empire. During the era of the Galactic Empire, Voss had become known as an unremarkable mining world, and the Empire unsuccessfully attempted to create more industry on the planet.</t>

During the Imperial Era, it was home to the Corulag Imperial Military Academy, training many of the finest minds the Imperial military had to offer. Following the death of the Emperor it lost much of its influence.</t>

			<t id="920501">Nirauan</t>
			<t id="920502">The second planet of a weak red star in Wild Space, Nirauan is a jungle world inhabited by two sentient avian species, the Qom Jha and Qom Qae. It is also the headquarters of Grand Admiral Thrawn's Empire of the Hand, operating from an ancient tower called the Hand of Thrawn.</t>

			<t id="920601">Corbos</t>
			<t id="920602">Corbos is a desert planet near the Yavin system. Though rich in ores, it is uninhabited, and typically avoided by colonists and miners, due to massive thunderstorms that render large sections of the surface inhospitable. Thousands of years ago, Corbos was the site of the final battle of the Hundred-Year Darkness, a major conflict between the Jedi Order and Dark Jedi separatists. Though the Dark Jedi lost the battle and were exiled from the Republic, they left bioengineered creatures known as Leviathans on the planet's surface, which destroyed the periodic mining colonies brave enough to set up on Corbos.</t>

			<t id="920701">Thule</t>
			<t id="920702">Thule is a dry, arid world that has long been connected to the Dark Side of the Force. Originally a part of the empire of Xim the Despot, Thule was colonised by ancient Sith who eventually drove many of its native life to extinction. For thousands of years, it has remained isolated and relatively unknown to the galaxy at large. From the Sith Empires of the Old Republic Era, to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, to the Galactic Empire and Emperor Palpatine, Thule has served as an isolated stronghold and resource world for Sith Lords. During the Clone Wars, the Techno Union deployed soldiers to Thule to reconstruct and reactivate an ancient Sith superweapon, the Dark Reaper. It was destroyed by Jedi Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi before it could be used. During the Imperial Era, Emperor Palpatine erased knowledge of Thule of the planet from all databases, historical accounts, and navigational records.</t>

			<t id="920801">Ordo</t>
			<t id="920802">The planet Ordo, in the Ordo system of the Mandalore sector, is the homeworld of the Mandalorian Clan Ordo, whose ancient member Canderous Ordo became Mandalore the Preserver after the Mandalorian Wars. It is mostly a desert planet, though its equator is ringed with some vegetation. Ordo is home to the Archaic Arsenal, a museum which housed a number of Mandalorian weaponry and armour.</t>

			<t id="920901">Kalevala</t>
			<t id="920902">Kalevala is the fourth planet in the Mandalore system, and neighbour to the Mandalorian's homeworld of Mandalore. A toxic desert world, Kalevala is the home of House Kryze, and the birthplace of the late Duchess Satine Kryze, former ruler of the Mandalorian Sector. The planet produces fine wines and rich textiles, and Kalevala Spaceworks manufactures custom luxury spacecraft such as the Nau'ur-class yachts First Light, owned by Dryden Vos, and the Coronet, used by Duchess Satine and her New Mandalorian Government.</t>

			<t id="921001">Taris</t>
			<t id="921002">Taris is a polluted urban planet located in the Outer Rim. Although Taris is a heavily populated ecumenopolis, much of the surface itself was polluted with wrecked starships and dense, overgrown swamps. Makeshift tenements made of shipping containers and crashed starships stacked on top of one another, while yellow smog drifted in the atmosphere. The elite of the planet dwelled in nicer skyscrapers. </t>

			<t id="921101">Morellia</t>
			<t id="921102">No information on this system.</t>

			<t id="921201">Anteevy</t>
			<t id="921202">Anteevy is an icy world in the Mid Rim. Once conquered by Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders, it eventually fell into Republic hands. Anteevy seceded during the Clone Wars, but was later annexed by the Galactic Empire, which created a factory to manufacture specially-modified AT-ATs that could withstand extreme cold.</t>

			<t id="921301">Baros</t>
			<t id="921302">Baros is a remote, arid world in the Outer Rim. Although it was first discovered many thousands of years before the rise of the Galactic Empire, it did not attract attention until that government received reports of coded messages being transmitted from its surface. Its reptilian natives, the Brubb, had begun sending those messages after theorizing that other sapient life existed in the galaxy.</t>

			<t id="921401">Targonn</t>
			<t id="921402">Targonn is a world located in the outer edge of the galaxy. Home to the avian Targonnian species, this mountainous planet was ruled by a "Dictator-Forever" until it was liberated by an opposition group.</t>

			<t id="921501">Wild Space 2</t>
			<t id="921502">Out in the farthest fringes of the galaxy, beyond the Outer Rim, life is unpredictable and dangerous.</t>

			<t id="921601">Wild Space 1</t>
			<t id="921602">Many strange and dangerous things may be found out beyond the farthest reaches of known space. Few explorers venture this far out, and fewer still return.</t>

			<t id="921701">Renatasia</t>
			<t id="921702">The Renatasia system of the Outer Rim was one of many lost colonies founded from Core Worlders under the Old Republic. During the rule of the Galactic Empire, it was rediscovered by the Centrality sector, and following an undercover operation to unify the world's government the planet was subjugated by Imperial forces.</t>

			<t id="921801">Rothana</t>
			<t id="921802">Rothana is a remote, icy world near the edge of the Outer Rim and Wild Space. Its most important feature is the headquarters of Rothana Heavy Engineering, a major supplier for military hardware to the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. \n Discovered by scouts centuries before the fall of the Republic, Rothana's location was sold to Kuat Drive Yards, which spent significant effort to develop mines, factories, and shipyards on the planet. Far from Core Worlds politics, Kuat used Rothana to pursue secret projects, and did not even let its own ships know the location of the system.</t>

			<t id="921901">Roon</t>
			<t id="921902">Roon is a legendary world located deep in the Outer Rim Territories. Hidden within a cosmic dust cloud referred to as the Cloak of the Sith, easily-navigable hyperspace routes to Roon had long been lost, leading to high demand for native crystals called Roonstones.\n It is believed that the world was visited and settled by the ancient Taung species, after their exodus from Coruscant. Seven thousand years before the rise of the Empire, the Taung abandoned Roon and emigrated to the world that would come to be called Mandalore. Later inhabitants arrived to the world six thousand years later, close to the end of the New Sith Wars.</t>

			<t id="922001">Gaulus</t>
			<t id="922002">Gaulus is a terrestrial world in the Outer Rim. The Rebel Alliance once used this world as a base of operations, though they were eventually forced to retreat and escape from the Empire.</t>

			<t id="922101">Lasan</t>
			<t id="922102">Lasan is a planet located in Wild Space that served as a secondary homeworld to the Lasat species, following the loss of contact with their original world, Lira San. When the Galactic Empire established its rule over the galaxy, Lasan resisted and challenged Imperial dominance, leading the Empire to invade the planet and attempt to exterminate the Lasat people.\n The commander of the siege, Alexandr Kallus of the Imperial Security Bureau, later defected and joined the Rebellion, fighting alongside one of the Lasat survivors, Garazeb Orrelios.</t>

			<t id="401">Ah, nice to meet you.</t>
			<t id="402">My job here is to help coordinate our efforts against our enemy.</t>
			<t id="403">If you're here, it means you have been recognised as a true friend.</t>
			<t id="404">There is a great need for pilots like you.</t>
			<t id="405">Our enemy has been a constant threat throughout our history. Many see them as a force of nature, something we have to weather and survive, but the reality is, this is a war.</t>
			<t id="406">We can't just throw every passing pilot at the enemy. Any potential recruits will undergo a probation period.</t>
			<t id="407">Each engagement needs to be a victory or they'll overrun us. I'm sure you knew that or you wouldn't be here. Let's get started.</t>
			<t id="408">Any questions?</t>
			<t id="409">Sorry, but this is a high-risk situation. We require pilots who have proven themselves.</t>
			<t id="410">There will be a wide range of tasks, from combat deployments to construction work. Depending on the situation, you will have a selection of tasks to choose from.</t>
			<t id="411">(unused)You will be paid as you complete your allotted tasks, with a potential bonus at the end.</t>
			<t id="412">(unused)As someone who's been toe to toe with the Xenon I'm sure you know what they are capable of.</t>
			<t id="413">(unused)The Xenon are a 'race' of intelligent, replicating machines and they have been a looming threat throughout our history.</t>
			<t id="414">(unused)They were originally created to help the Terrans explore the stars and terraform worlds but trying to control Artificial General Intelligence proved costly.</t>
			<t id="415">(unused)And now, hundreds of years later, we're still trying to clean up their mistake but we have no idea how far they have spread throughout the universe.</t>
			<t id="416">(unused)All we can do is hold out and prevent them from spreading any further. Every other government, allied or not, is faced with the Xenon threat. It's about the only thing we can all agree on.</t>
			<t id="417">(unused)We've even had temporary ceasefires with the Holy Order when faced with a Xenon attack. Quite temporary though.</t>
			<t id="418">Anything else?</t>
			<t id="419">Sorry. We're still reviewing your performance from the last time.</t>
			<t id="420">Alright. I'll have a suitable task picked out for you momentarily.</t>
			<t id="421">Stay safe out there, pilot.</t>
			<t id="422">You will now find tasks related to our enemy in your mission interface.</t>
			<!-- generic mission briefings: can be used anywhere. customisable in the specific war subs' page. -->
			<t id="1000">(common briefing texts)</t>
			<t id="1100">(briefing - negative mood - section 1)</t>
			<t id="1101">The %2 activity has been increasing for some time now and we must be prepared for the case that we are their target.</t>
			<t id="1102">While lacking, our intelligence network in the %2 space seems to suggest that an attack in imminent.</t>
			<t id="1200">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>
			<t id="1201">While we believe that the %2 are intelligent enough to learn from their actions, they continue to make the mistake of challenging us.</t>
			<t id="1202">Our recon ships, at great risk to themselves, successfully provided vital information on the %2 activity. This gives us a major upper-hand in our operations.</t>
			<!-- specific mission texts below. customisable in the specific war subs' page. -->
			<t id="3000">(title variants)Build Defence</t>
			<t id="3001">Defence Preparations</t>
			<t id="3002">Safeguard against Potential Invasion</t>
			<t id="3010">(briefing - negative mood - section 1)</t>
			<t id="3011">The %2 seem to be becoming more bold, if they are even capable of such behaviour. After probing our defences in the previous skirmishes, they seem to think our space is an easy target. Unfortunately, they're not far wrong.</t>
			<t id="3012">While Federation Intelligence continues to analyse recent %2 behaviour, we must make sure that our defences are prepared for the likely event of further %2 aggression.</t>
			<t id="3020">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
			<t id="3021">There are a number of high-priority tasks which will be vital in securing our space.</t>
			<t id="3030">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
			<t id="3031">The %2 have time and again proven to be a menace, but as we continue to learn about them, our ability to defend and fight back effectively improves. It is imperative that we hold out so that we can counter as soon as we are able.</t>
			<t id="3032">We have a short window to shore up our defences and ready our people for the potential push from the %2. We're looking for independent contractors to help us with this.</t>
			<t id="3040">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>
			<t id="3041">The %2 do not seem to understand why they continue to fail when attempting to engage us in our own space. While that is not to say we have not suffered losses, we pride ourselves on our strong defences against the 'force of nature' that is the %2.</t>
			<t id="3042">Our reconnaissance teams confirm a build up of %2 ships in their space and expect that they may soon make a move on us. While we have this respite, we will continue to prepare our defences.</t>
			<t id="3050">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
			<t id="3051">We have learned much in the many years of conflict with the %2 and we must use that knowledge to continue pushing them back.</t>
			<t id="3060">(briefing - positive mood - section 3)</t>
			<t id="3061">We are preparing a large-scale effort in shoring up our defences in cooperation with local corporations and neighbouring allies. Any skilled pilots are also encouraged to take part.</t>
			<t id="4000">(title variants)Large-Scale Defence Construction</t>
			<t id="4001">Heavy Construction Operation</t>
			<t id="4010">(briefing - negative mood - section 1)</t>
			<t id="4011">Given the apparent strength of the %2 forces amassing in their space, we current find ourselves at a disadvantage unless we can respond in kind and strengthen our own fleets and defences.</t>
			<t id="4012">Our recent losses to the %2 have left us at a distinct disadvantage should they continue their push into our space. We must continue to push on with securing our space and protecting our people.</t>
			<t id="4020">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
			<t id="4021">With our forces being stretched we will begin a drive to shoring up our defences with the construction of defensive structures and new ships. While this is taxing on our infrastructure, it is imperative that we don't give the %2 a free pass into our space.</t>
			<t id="4030">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
			<t id="4031">We are looking for able individuals to aid our shipwrights as well as potentially invest significant time and resources into new construction projects.</t>
			<t id="4032">While we only have a short window to shore up our defences, we expect any help in these areas will play a key part in future engagements with the %2.</t>
			<t id="4040">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>
			<t id="4041">The %2 do have the advantage of self-replication to help shore up their numbers, but we have shown time and time again that the %1 Navy can put up a fight, even against the odds.</t>
			<t id="4042">Groups of %2 ships continue to mass around several entry points into our space. We don't know if they're aware that they are being monitored but it gives us a good look at their current strength.</t>
			<t id="4050">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
			<t id="4051">Now is the time to make sure that our warships and static defences are ready to give the %2 a grand welcome once they decide to give us a visit.</t>
			<t id="4060">(briefing - positive mood - section 3)</t>
			<t id="4061">We are looking for individuals able to provide significant time and resources in helping us complete a number of large construction projects.</t>
			<t id="4062">Individuals with experience in station or ship construction are encouraged to help aid with the coordination of several defence projects.</t>
			<t id="5000">(title variants)Secure Resources</t>
			<t id="5001">Safeguarding Resource Supplies</t>
			<t id="5010">(briefing - negative mood - section 1)</t>
			<t id="5011">If there's one thing we have in common with the %2, it's our reliance on the natural resources in our respective territories. Of course, they have the advantage that they don't need to maintain farms like we do.</t>
			<t id="5012">One of the areas that the %2 seem drawn to are our resource fields where they often harass our mining ships. We also assume they're scouting for resources which they can use for their replication.</t>
			<t id="5020">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
			<t id="5021">If we are to continue our struggle against them, as well as simply survive, we must be sure that our factories and shipyards continue to get the resources they need.</t>
			<t id="5030">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
			<t id="5031">Our supply lines have previously been disrupted by %2 activity to the point that it became a substantial risk to our fighting ability. To safeguard against this, we are to focus on preparing our infrastructure for any potential economic shock the %2 may cause.</t>
			<t id="5032">The recent %2 activity, as well as our war with the Holy Order has put a sizeable strain on our infrastructure and supply lines, leaving us with slow construction projects and the onset of rationing. As we can not allow this to continue we are requesting the willing and able pilots to help us reverse the situation.</t>
			<t id="5040">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>
			<t id="5041">We expect the conflict with the %2 will once again have some skirmishes occur in our territory. While we have enough measures in place to mitigate their activity, we must ere on the side of caution, especially when it comes to our supply lines.</t>
			<t id="5042">It seems that the %2 are preparing for some raids into our space. We are confident in our defences but it is foolish to underestimate the amount of damage the %2 can cause when they run amok, especially to freighters and mining ships.</t>
			<t id="5050">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
			<t id="5051">As we continue to press the %2, we must guarantee that our economy continues to function smoothly. This will include protecting our supply lines and mining areas as well as searching for any new sources of raw resources.</t>
			<t id="5060">(briefing - positive mood - section 3)</t>
			<t id="5061">We have a number of tasks to both relieve economic stress on our infrastructure as well as safeguard supply lines and resource gathering areas. If you have the facilities to help, please consider signing up for assignment.</t>
			<t id="6000">(title variants)Gather Intel</t>
			<t id="6001">Intelligence</t>
			<t id="6010">(briefing - negative mood - section 1)</t>
			<t id="6011">While we expect that the ever-restless %2 are preparing another offensive against us, our intelligence agencies currently lack the resources to help us prepare our defences effectively.</t>
			<t id="6012">In recent weeks we have been working with nought but rumour as we try to get on top of the %2's activities and intentions. While we know a new offensive is coming, details such as ship numbers and location remain lacking.</t>
			<t id="6020">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
			<t id="6021">Our best people have been hard at work to come up with ways to help us improve the our intel and give us a helping hand in tracking the %2. Any solid information will give us a much higher chance to counter further aggression.</t>
			<t id="6022">Over the many years of attempting to better understand the %2, we have taken many risks such as going deep into their space or salvaging their wreckage. Any interaction with %2, even those rendered inert, is thwart with danger.</t>
			<t id="6030">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
			<t id="6031">We have a number of tasks available, some of which may involve spending time in %2 territory or even interacting with the %2 themselves. As such, these tasks are designated heavy risk. We require pilots confident enough to go behind enemy lines and skilled enough to come back safely.</t>
			<t id="6032">A number of intel tasks are available. That said, given the dangers that operations in %2 space pose, we are only looking for pilots who are confident in their ability to work behind enemy lines as well as get back in one piece.</t>
			<t id="6040">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>
			<t id="6041">Despite having favourable outcomes in our recent engagements with the %2, we can't overlook that our intelligence agencies are often working with outdated information.</t>
			<t id="6042">If we want to continue holding the %2 back the way we have been we must ensure that our intelligence is both up to date and reliable.</t>
			<t id="6050">(briefing - positive mood - section 2)</t>
			<t id="6051">We have several options available to us to improve our intel to allow us to formulate better strategies against the %2.</t>
			<t id="6060">(briefing - positive mood - section 3)</t>
			<t id="6061">We are looking for trusted and skilled individuals to perform a number of these tasks, helping us maintain the upper hand.</t>
			<t id="7000">(title variants)Preemptive Offensive</t>
			<t id="7001">Deterrence</t>
			<t id="7010">(briefing - negative mood - section 1)</t>
			<t id="7011">The %2 have been pressing us quite hard recently, but it seems that we have an opening to deal them a blow. Any distraction which pulls them away from our space will give us a much welcome reprieve.</t>
			<t id="7012">With the %2 being a constant sight for such a long period of time, it has felt that we were on the back foot. However, our intelligence teams have found several targets worth engaging in the hope that it will have the %2 pull back somewhat.</t>
			<t id="7020">(briefing - negative mood - section 2)</t>
			<t id="7021">We will take any opportunity to repair our defences and redeploy our forces.</t>
			<t id="7030">(briefing - negative mood - section 3)</t>
			<t id="7031">We would be fools to think we can predict what the %2 will do, but we know that if we hit them hard enough, they will have no choice but to send at least a large chunk of their forces back home. We're looking for level-headed and skilled pilots, capable of doing the job and getting home safely.</t>
			<t id="7032">They may have forced our hand but the %2 are just as vulnerable to hit-and-run tactics as anyone else. As long as those involved come back safe, we believe this is worth the effort. Even if it doesn't have the desired effect, it will at least give the %2 something to waste CPU cycles on.</t>
			<t id="7040">(briefing - positive mood - section 1)</t>

We want you to prepare that offensive by going after our future target's defensive systems and disabling certain turrets of key importance.\n\nStation: $STATION$\nAmount of turrets to destroy: $TURRETS$</t>

			<t id="10011">Prelude to Galactic War (-32)</t>
			<t id="10012">As planned by Darth Sidious, the Trade Federation blockades Naboo in protest of the Senate's decision to tax their much-used Free Trade Zones, escalating the trade disputes; Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum secretly dispatches Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to serve as the ambassadors for scheduled negotiations with the Federation in hopes of resolving the Naboo Crisis.\nInvasion of Naboo; Darth Sidious further manipulates the Trade Federation leadership into instigating a peace crisis for the Republic with the deployment of military forces for the occupation of the harmonious world of Naboo.\nJedi Master Sifo-Dyas foresees an upcoming full-scale conflict, but is accused of war-mongering and removed from the Jedi Council. He secretly commissions the Kaminoans of the distant planet Kamino to grow a clone army for the Republic.\nPadmé Amidala steps down following two two-year terms as Queen of Naboo. Réillata defeats Jamillia in her campaign to succeed Amidala, though Jamillia later reigns for four years before being succeeded by Neeyutnee during the Clone Wars.\n</t>

			<t id="10021">Clone Wars (-22)</t>
			<t id="10022">Plot to assassinate Senator Amidala; Separatist leaders hope to silence the senator from Naboo, who opposes the Military Creation Act. Anakin Skywalker is charged with the protection of Senator Padmé Amidala, and they covertly travel to her homeworld while Obi-Wan Kenobi searches for the assassin.
